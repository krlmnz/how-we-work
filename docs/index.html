      <p>The creation of the Garment District is one of the most important events in the history of American urban planning and politics, and one that has had enormous consequences for the shape of New York City today. A skilled labor force made New York City a global powerhouse in apparel manufacturing.

      <p>At its peak in 1947, more than a million New Yorkers worked in factories. That number began to decrease by 1996, the city had only 72,000 workers in the apparel industry overall. In 2000, apparel manufacturing accounted for 33.2 percent of all manufacturing jobs in the city and food manufacturing accounted for 8.9 percent. In 2014, food accounted for 21.6 percent and apparel 20.7 percent.

      <p>The Garment District has been synonymous with design since its inception in 1919, and today it is still the living center of American fashion design, home to the greatest concentration of fashion designers in the country.But beneath the gloss of fashion lies a rich history of the people who gave life to this colorful and enduring New York neighborhood. </p>
