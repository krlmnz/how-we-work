a,00:00:00.00 - 00:00:19.51,"it was very official, this session is now being reported um Yeah, and we shoot for like 45 minutes, so but we have until one if you want to end early or if you want to keep going to you and there's no wrong answers at all."
a,00:00:19.51 - 00:00:28.62,"We're just very interested in, you know how you do your work and what kind of workflows you you have and um processes."
a,00:00:28.63 - 00:00:31.53,"Um so yeah, I'll just introduce myself quickly."
a,00:00:31.54 - 00:01:07.22,"I am a product designer, I have worked in the city and sustainability space, urban tech and sustainability world for about five years now and um I designed software in that field and really enjoyed speaking to professionals network and you know, those worlds and adjacent um Yeah, I would love to first um here um you know about yourself, any general introduction and especially about your responsibilities and how you came into sustainability as a professional."
a,00:01:07.23 - 00:01:08.62,Sure.
a,00:01:08.63 - 00:01:24.91,"Um Well, hi I'm name-extracted, I am the Director of sustainability at comparny-name-extracted um and our team at company-name-extracted were comprised of three people um and we cover both the social impact and environmental responsibility initiatives at the company."
a,00:01:25.17 - 00:01:37.73,Um We so we have both kind of pieces of sustainability under one team but we all work really cross functionally together to um kind of make sure that we're hitting all of the goals that we've set out for ourselves.
a,00:01:38.47 - 00:01:57.77,"We actually sit on the supply chain team, so I report directly into the Chief supply chain Officer, which I think is really important to note just because in the apparel and footwear industry um whether you're talking about social impacts and needs or environmental um impacts and kind of risks."
a,00:01:57.78 - 00:02:27.63,"Uh the majority of those are happening in supply chain um Just kind of the nature of the way that the the industry is kind of set up, so we do everything from social compliance of our audits, you know, auditing for our our upstream suppliers and factories to doing things like setting science based targets, monitoring our restricted substance list and chemical usage, um adhering to our preferred material standards."
a,00:02:27.63 - 00:02:32.13,We really do quite a lot under this one umbrella of sustainability.
a,00:02:32.49 - 00:02:53.89,"Um So that's kind of like the behind the scenes work that we do, but we also work really cross functionally with our marketing and creative cohorts across the business to ensure that we're also kind of telling our story in a way that's um validated and transparent and meaningful um and also engaging to our customers."
a,00:02:53.89 - 00:03:02.10,So we kind of straddle the line of those two sides of doing the work and then helping to tell the story of of what we're doing behind the scenes.
a,00:03:02.46 - 00:03:05.91,Um I don't know if that's good enough introduction for you.
a,00:03:05.91 - 00:03:06.49,Okay.
a,00:03:06.50 - 00:03:09.70,"Yeah, it's really interestingly, yeah."
a,00:03:09.71 - 00:03:26.76,"Um So I guess we'll start at like the very top and we'll work towards like just very specific like flows but from the highest level, where does the motivation for sustainability um come from?"
a,00:03:26.76 - 00:03:36.61,"Is it is it really that cause that marketing need or is it something that comes from wanting to a business perspective, or?"
a,00:03:37.17 - 00:03:45.80,"Yeah, who who is like setting these um initiatives um up as like a core responsibility of the business."
a,00:03:46.54 - 00:03:48.57,"Yeah, it's probably a bit of both."
a,00:03:48.57 - 00:04:10.97,"And I would say that we've um we've definitely evolved over the years, but from from the very beginning there's been we our brand just started about 10 years ago, so we're still fairly young and nimble and agile and we're not a huge, you know, organization with very complex, you know, reporting structures and huge teams."
a,00:04:10.97 - 00:04:12.79,So we're still fairly small.
a,00:04:12.97 - 00:04:26.19,"And the way that the company was founded was on this idea of transparency first to the customer, we started off by giving full cost breakdowns of all of our garments that we produced on our website and that was really novel at the time."
a,00:04:26.20 - 00:04:31.79,Um from there we kind of morphed and evolved into transparency of our supply chains.
a,00:04:31.79 - 00:04:46.21,"So again, we were one of the first companies to um really give insights into the partnerships that we were building upstream of who was actually doing the work of manufacturing, putting together the products that we were creating."
a,00:04:46.22 - 00:04:56.99,"Um and so that's kind of seamlessly evolved more so into including more of the environmental metrics and also social um metrics as well, which is kind of where we are today."
a,00:04:56.99 - 00:04:58.63,So it's sort of been part of our D.N.A.
a,00:04:59.13 - 00:05:18.64,"In one way or another since the very beginning and I think that that core so we've sort of had like a mission driven organization from um from kind of the inception of the brand, it's just kind of taken different different stages depending on on the time of our iteration."
a,00:05:18.97 - 00:05:26.59,Um So we do have a mission today that is very core to how we work and operate.
a,00:05:27.15 - 00:05:35.48,"Um And it's it's also our sustainability mission as well, so um I think that's kind of driving at the core."
a,00:05:35.48 - 00:05:50.05,And then we also have from a very kind of top level perspective all of our c suite in some way shape or form now have sustainability metrics kind of built into their performance uh performance.
a,00:05:50.06 - 00:05:51.83,Um Kpi s.
a,00:05:51.84 - 00:05:57.89,Um And so those kind of trickle down into into each of the individual teams that we're working with.
a,00:05:57.89 - 00:06:05.56,So it's sort of the piece that I think differentiates us and sets us apart but we're also really powerful storytellers.
a,00:06:05.57 - 00:06:09.76,So um I wouldn't minimize the marketing angle either.
a,00:06:09.77 - 00:06:15.51,Um I think we really see that as as this is kind of our differentiating feature and we want to talk about it.
a,00:06:15.52 - 00:06:23.28,Um We also want to create a movement with our customers and with our communities where we're selling and where we're operating so um.
a,00:06:23.94 - 00:06:24.89,Yeah.
a,00:06:24.90 - 00:06:25.90,Yeah it's awesome.
a,00:06:25.91 - 00:06:32.73,Um Yeah I remember whenever linda started um and I was like well this seems like a less expensive.
a,00:06:32.74 - 00:06:39.30,"Still sure so I'm gonna go there and I've been to the store in Soho, it's a really great experience all through."
a,00:06:39.31 - 00:06:40.75,Yeah.
a,00:06:40.76 - 00:06:55.93,"Um So um there's definitely a lot of interesting parts that you've mentioned, but we've heard that there's a lot of from our experience um there's a lot of issues with supply chain um data gathering and management."
a,00:06:55.94 - 00:06:59.19,Um Would you like what is that process?
a,00:06:59.19 - 00:07:01.40,"Like, like how do you find your suppliers?"
a,00:07:01.40 - 00:07:03.13,How do you survey them?
a,00:07:03.14 - 00:07:05.23,Um how do you audit them?
a,00:07:05.23 - 00:07:09.92,"And like what is, what are the biggest challenges with your suppliers?"
a,00:07:11.05 - 00:07:11.95,Oh gosh.
a,00:07:11.96 - 00:07:15.96,Uh that's a that's a lot of question.
a,00:07:15.97 - 00:07:23.94,"Um Sorry, I also have Covid right now, so if I might need to mute occasionally just to talk it out."
a,00:07:23.95 - 00:07:29.26,Um So uh a few different things.
a,00:07:29.26 - 00:07:44.16,"So we many of our factories, we've actually, I don't know the exact percentage today, it's got to be like 65 70% of the factories that we've worked with, we've actually had relationships with for five years or more."
a,00:07:44.17 - 00:08:24.43,"So the majority of our upstream suppliers are people that have been in our network for quite a while, but because of a lot of the recent supply chain challenges and changes primarily due to Covid but also for other uh kind of socio political um issues, we have been kind of exploring additional partnerships, so the way that we find um factories and facilities is probably very similar to the way others do just by by researching, we also get a fair amount of um of factories and suppliers reaching out to us because they want to work with us."
a,00:08:24.44 - 00:08:55.17,"Um So it kind of depends, we do have a pretty rigorous um uh what we call like a risk assessment where we collect a lot of documentation up front around the kind of performance of the factory, not just on the quality and technical side which we have people in our quality and sourcing and product development teams who are asking about like equipment and machinery and like what kind of no house and you know cost breakdowns and things like that."
a,00:08:55.17 - 00:08:57.89,So there's like a business side of our risk assessment.
a,00:08:58.23 - 00:09:09.31,Um And then more importantly for the sustainability side we do a risk assessment based on um like history of social audit performance.
a,00:09:09.31 - 00:09:16.11,So we ask for historical records um that the the facilities can share with us.
a,00:09:16.11 - 00:09:23.95,We're also looking at um whether or not they have certain certifications that also align with the work that we're doing.
a,00:09:23.96 - 00:09:27.11,Either on a material side or on a process side.
a,00:09:27.11 - 00:09:29.41,So it can be a G.O.T.S
a,00:09:29.86 - 00:09:35.77,Certification for being for producing uh uh organic cotton goods.
a,00:09:35.78 - 00:09:43.22,It can be a GRS certification for being able to produce um certified recycled good materials or products.
a,00:09:43.23 - 00:09:45.38,Um But it can also be like a Z.H.C.
a,00:09:45.85 - 00:09:51.49,Certification which is for um water and chemical practices.
a,00:09:51.49 - 00:09:57.69,So we're kind of looking on on a few different fronts and it sort of depends on what the specialty of that factory is.
a,00:09:58.04 - 00:10:10.18,"But we do, we have like a matrix that we we plug different, um, different performance values into that kind of gives us whether or not this this factory could kind of fit our needs or be a good partner."
a,00:10:10.19 - 00:10:21.05,"Um, I think a big part of what we, what we try to stress is communication and um, we we like to have meetings prior to covid, we would have done a lot of this in person."
a,00:10:21.32 - 00:10:23.86,"Um, but right now we're doing a lot of it over zoom."
a,00:10:23.86 - 00:10:37.12,"So we go through a pretty rigorous, uh, kind of upfront vetting process and then before we ever, um, you know, place any orders or start any production in a factory."
a,00:10:37.12 - 00:10:40.94,"We do our own, um, third party audit assessment."
a,00:10:40.94 - 00:10:46.50,"So we work with a company called Elevate, um, and also another company called arch advisors."
a,00:10:46.51 - 00:10:58.67,"And those are two third party social compliance, um, environmental compliance, uh, companies that, that have a lot of boots on the ground, a lot of, um, throughout the world."
a,00:10:58.67 - 00:11:03.65,"So there, you know, they cover a lot of different geographical regions."
a,00:11:03.65 - 00:11:05.53,They speak a lot of the local languages.
a,00:11:05.53 - 00:11:11.92,They have an understanding of some of the nuances of things like migrant labor and various countries or regions.
a,00:11:11.92 - 00:11:17.18,"And so they we do, we don't do any of this in house because we just don't have the knowledge or expertise."
a,00:11:17.18 - 00:11:24.15,"And we're also um, really contained by what we're able to where we're able to go right now."
a,00:11:24.37 - 00:11:36.60,So we leverage these third parties who go out on our behalf and complete a full audit of each facility far before we ever um would place an order in any factory.
a,00:11:36.61 - 00:11:48.60,"So we do that process and then we continue to do that year after year, just as kind of a um uh on this path kind of we we say towards continuous improvement."
a,00:11:48.61 - 00:12:11.79,"Um so we're tracking kind of progress and outcomes of these audits over time um with the hope that eventually um you know, maybe we won't have to do them anymore, but that's kind of a very far um not something that that that the industry is uh is really ready for, but that's kind of the idea is that all of these places will be operating well."
a,00:12:12.33 - 00:12:17.03,Um And then on the environmental side we use a couple of different tools.
a,00:12:17.04 - 00:12:33.12,"I think first of all, we we try to align ourselves with factories that already inherently have some type of environmental um metric kind of or or they're doing something kind of above and beyond to begin with."
a,00:12:33.12 - 00:12:50.57,So we work with a lot of factories that um are kind of on the cutting edge of various technologies that help with water savings and recovery or chemical management or um just kind of specialize depending on what their expertise is.
a,00:12:50.57 - 00:12:52.05,So you mentioned silk.
a,00:12:52.05 - 00:13:04.21,"So we work with this great factory um in china that uh is leed certified and they have solar solar panels, you know, direct solar on their roofs."
a,00:13:04.21 - 00:13:09.62,And they have this amazing kind of blue sign certified chemical and water recovery process.
a,00:13:09.62 - 00:13:20.49,So we try to find like these special um factories and makers throughout the world to our specialists and what they do but are also doing what they do better than the rest.
a,00:13:20.50 - 00:13:28.14,Um so that's kind of another point that that we really try to search for in building out those long term relationships.
a,00:13:29.11 - 00:13:34.93,But we are also um uh using using a tool called the Hig F.E.M.
a,00:13:35.56 - 00:13:38.96,This is a a tool that the S.A.C.
a,00:13:39.40 - 00:13:45.79,"Or the sustainable apparel coalition has been building for the past, I don't know a decade and a half or something."
a,00:13:46.11 - 00:13:59.88,Um and so the facilities tool specifically is an annual uh kind of survey that has been audited or verified by a third party and and they are collecting information across a number of different indicators.
a,00:13:59.88 - 00:14:13.61,"So we're looking at um air emissions, looking at electricity use, um water use and consumption, water effluent waste generation uh details on materials."
a,00:14:13.62 - 00:14:32.26,"So there's a whole host, it's a very extensive um kind of survey and that's really the best way aside from our our audits that were performing um that's the best way that we're really getting kind of detailed factual information on an environmental perspective from each of our factories."
a,00:14:32.27 - 00:14:47.08,"So we're in the process of rolling this out, I think um about 90% of our Tier one factories are now on boarded and something like 80% of our strategic tier two um are on this platform as well."
a,00:14:47.08 - 00:14:51.90,"So it's a really good way for us to kind of look at the dashboard, so to speak."
a,00:14:51.90 - 00:15:02.16,"It's not really built in a dashboard format that we can download, download the individual results and kind of put them in a big spreadsheet and um see trends and track them over time."
a,00:15:02.17 - 00:15:09.12,So that's sort of what we're doing and are the factories in putting all this information themselves is a very manual for them.
a,00:15:09.12 - 00:15:14.95,"Like how do you, how do you, how do you know it's accurate or is that the auditing process?"
a,00:15:14.96 - 00:15:17.16,So that's the verification part of it.
a,00:15:17.16 - 00:15:30.18,So um there and and the majority of the facilities that we're working with right now do have their scores verified there in the inputs verified at this point.
a,00:15:30.40 - 00:15:49.86,"Um, and we have kind of like a, a work up to this point as well, so maybe like the first year of partnership, we just have them do a self assessment and then we build it in that the second year, you know, depending how things are going, we work with them for the year, we'll have them go through the verification process etcetera, etcetera."
a,00:15:49.87 - 00:15:56.10,So I think the first time is probably the most cumbersome and difficult.
a,00:15:56.11 - 00:16:19.83,"But what's good about this platform is um the year over year kind of scores or details would be uh you can kind of like carry them over, so it's, you don't have to go through necessarily like all of the same work and calculations, but you know, like what kind of details and documents you need to gather to kind of complete it."
a,00:16:19.83 - 00:16:28.52,"So I think like with all of these reporting mechanisms, there is a level of probably difficulty and and time consumption that goes into it."
a,00:16:28.53 - 00:16:58.73,"Um but what's also good about Hig is it's at least to my knowledge, the only kind of unified um survey that a lot of these factories are receiving and it's becoming a bit um it's not quite ubiquitous, but I think it's, it's kind of on its way to that path where a lot of brands in particular are, are kind of requiring this of of at least tier one factories."
a,00:16:58.74 - 00:17:08.32,"Um so I think, you know, a factory just has to do it once and if another brand has already asked them to do it, they can just share those results with us or vice versa."
a,00:17:08.32 - 00:17:11.45,"If we've asked them to do it, they can send it to somebody else who's asking for it."
a,00:17:11.46 - 00:17:26.87,"So it's kind of a unified system where we're collecting the exact same information across the industry and across factories for really easy kind of benchmarks and comparisons and um hot spot analysis, it's really interesting."
a,00:17:26.88 - 00:17:34.60,"Um Yeah, the fashion industry definitely has, like a lot of sustainability tools that I'm sure are very specific to."
a,00:17:34.61 - 00:17:36.06,Yeah.
a,00:17:36.07 - 00:17:58.70,"Um so in your team, um it sounds like you've had um well from what I saw in your linkedin, you've had an education and sustainability, but is that is that common, or is there any type of education that you have to do once you receive these materials, like how do you translate them and make them useful for the rest of the organization, or?"
a,00:17:58.71 - 00:18:04.39,"Yeah, maybe not useful, but yeah, what is that, you know, share out process to your stakeholders?"
a,00:18:04.40 - 00:18:06.46,"Yeah, that's a really good question."
a,00:18:06.46 - 00:18:14.40,That's something that um we we take a lot of care to pay a lot of attention to.
a,00:18:14.41 - 00:19:16.66,"Um and I think that's why I mentioned the piece about how closely we work with our marketing team in the beginning is um I think we both, because of our size, we're also what we're also a privately held company and sustainability kind of broadly has sort of been part of our our messaging and our our yeah, our reason why um for for a very long time, so it's really important that we get the story right, And um but that also it's the same is true for our internal storytelling as well, um because we really need kind of everybody to be on board and to be aligned with these bigger missions, you know, the bigger mission and these goals that we've set out for ourselves because they really are quite tough and it's not something that the rest of the industry kind of largely is doing, so it takes a lot of work, um but I think it's also a reason why a lot of employees join company-name-extracted in to begin with."
a,00:19:17.37 - 00:19:46.77,"So um I do have one person on my team who is actually an environmental analyst and she also has an educational background in sustainability, um but specifically in agriculture and uh but she her previous work was all in communication, so she kind of also has this really interesting um uh kind of, I don't know, she's got a lot of skills both on the analytical side, but also on the calm side."
a,00:19:46.78 - 00:20:28.64,"So we do a lot of work just kind of internally educating um not just keeping everyone up to date, but actually going to specific teams and kind of helping them understand um what what our goals are and how they specifically influence or impact what those goals mean, So um we've done things like sort of internal road shows where we've gone around to all of the strategic kind of teams that we've identified as being part or impactful to a specific goal and we kind of help break it down for them, help them understand what we're looking for like this year versus five years away and like where we should sort of be long term."
a,00:20:29.15 - 00:20:46.42,"Um and we also do things like we hold office hours, we present in every I present in every monthly um uh company, all hands that we have on updates, where we just try to like, hit people on multiple kind of levels and layers to get them engaged and excited."
a,00:20:46.43 - 00:21:00.29,"Um and we found that that's really worked, at least for us, I mean, we still get tons of questions, people just, there's a lot of interest, people really want to know what we're up to, what we're doing and uh that we're actually doing what we say we're gonna do."
a,00:21:01.02 - 00:21:13.73,"So I sometimes feel more pressure from our internal teams than I do from like, press or anyone else that like, asks us questions about what we're doing, because it really is a hard, it's a high bar to live up to."
a,00:21:13.74 - 00:21:28.45,"Um but I think at the end of the day, like, what we're really trying to do is make make our goals and and our work around sustainability, just part of the regular kind of almost equivalent to business acumen."
a,00:21:28.45 - 00:21:37.37,"So, as the finance team in all hands is presenting on our financials as like, you know, all of these like, traditional business units are presenting."
a,00:21:37.37 - 00:21:46.86,We also have sustainability presenting right alongside them to show how how how or how not our goals are kind of lining up with each other.
a,00:21:46.86 - 00:22:04.13,"So I think it's really important from like that top down perspective, but that we're also getting in, you know, throughout various levels and across various teams like helping to really break down the science or the metrics um into a way that's really understandable for everybody."
a,00:22:04.14 - 00:22:08.28,Um and hopefully that also translates out to our customers as well.
a,00:22:08.81 - 00:22:42.25,"Yeah, I mean that sounds like a pretty utopian sustainability company based on like a lot of our people that we talked to, they're like we need to be better aligned with business goals and Yeah and you guys even have leadership KPI s tied to sustainability and that's something very specific heard before and like what how are those KPI s um like tracked and checked um like you have to go and say okay you met um your goals for this year."
a,00:22:42.26 - 00:22:51.28,Um do does the leadership understand how to achieve those goals or like what is what are the actions that are set in place?
a,00:22:51.29 - 00:22:54,"Yeah, that's a good question."
a,00:22:54 - 00:23:07.50,"And I'll also say that a lot of this kind of um more substantial side of like the goal setting, the strategic roadmap we've built, this is all just happened in the past year and a half."
a,00:23:07.51 - 00:23:09.33,So it's still a little new.
a,00:23:09.33 - 00:23:16.26,"So like all of these um these kind of specifics are really new to, to our organization."
a,00:23:16.27 - 00:23:31.73,Um It was the topics are not new but like the strategy and the tracking is um so the way that we're doing it is we're trying to actually build into all of our existing systems.
a,00:23:31.74 - 00:24:14.05,"so we already use a system right now where every individual in the company, no matter what your department or level, um you have to go in and set goals for yourselves, that kind of ladder up to our overarching company um company goals that we have like 3 to 5 strategic goals for the company, those then get distilled on the team basis, and then you have your individual goals that you're working towards, so we do that on a quarterly basis, and then we also have to write feedback for ourselves and have conversations with our direct managers about our goals and our progress and kind of what we want to work on in the future."
a,00:24:14.06 - 00:24:34.45,"So um this is something that our people team or our HR team is really in control of, but um depending on the team and and kind of like what our sustainability priorities are, specific teams will have those like sustainability goals that are built into that goal setting process."
a,00:24:34.46 - 00:25:04.60,"So um we have them for, we have really big preferred material schools, so this is something that our raw material sustainability product development and sourcing teams have written into their kind of goals for for this year, we only do it on like an annual basis, I kind of wish maybe we could do it a little further out, um but it's just it's just annual, so each quarter you kind of are like setting your little mini goals for that bigger annual goal."
a,00:25:04.81 - 00:25:14.56,"Um but we do the same thing for our carbon reduction goals, um we do the same thing for some of our social uh social impact measures."
a,00:25:14.57 - 00:25:20.33,Um and those are the really big ones.
a,00:25:20.34 - 00:25:22.91,"Oh, but then we also have like marketing goals as well."
a,00:25:22.92 - 00:25:34.81,"Um So depending on like the function and the and what the goals are, like, there will be specific kind of indicators that are being tracked that way."
a,00:25:34.82 - 00:25:40.68,I don't think it's a super um savvy.
a,00:25:41.52 - 00:26:04.82,"Um but that's just kind of like the best tool that we have right now, so I'm sure we're we're actually not um really tracking that closely, like how were we don't have like the agility or like the real time, uh like accuracy to see how how a team or how an individual is, is tracking at any given time."
a,00:26:06.22 - 00:26:11.45,But I think what we do see is the change in some of the numbers.
a,00:26:11.46 - 00:26:20.57,"So like we are tracking on it on a more macro level, like how we are transitioning from conventional cotton to organic based on like fabric count."
a,00:26:20.58 - 00:26:33.84,"Um Similarly for for carbon emissions, like we do similar exercises, we know um kind of what, depending on which factories we allocate to or which materials were building into."
a,00:26:33.84 - 00:26:40.89,We can kind of get a sense of directionally where our emissions profile is going to be for next year for instance.
a,00:26:40.90 - 00:26:49.05,"So I've seen like material things and yeah, that was like a lot of information."
a,00:26:49.57 - 00:26:51.19,Yeah.
a,00:26:51.20 - 00:27:02.40,When you say this tool that you used to track um I think your KPI is is that like just a KPI tracking tool or is this something that you know something that your HR team built into?
a,00:27:02.40 - 00:27:04.74,No it's it's called reflective with a.
a,00:27:04.74 - 00:27:05.69,K.
a,00:27:05.70 - 00:27:11.55,Um And it's I think it's something a lot of like startups kind of use.
a,00:27:11.55 - 00:27:18.20,It's just um I'm sure I'm sure we pay for access to it but it's basically just like a pr tracker.
a,00:27:18.21 - 00:27:26.40,Um And I think it's a way to help facilitate like conversations and goal setting between leaders and team members.
a,00:27:27.17 - 00:27:29.40,Um Cool.
a,00:27:29.40 - 00:27:35.49,So moving on to um Science based target work.
a,00:27:35.49 - 00:27:44.86,"Have you, has your organization put any resources towards um specifically the science based target initiative?"
a,00:27:45.39 - 00:27:47.24,What has that been like?
a,00:27:47.82 - 00:27:54.77,So we um were approved for our science-based target in October of 2021.
a,00:27:55.33 - 00:28:09.81,"Um And pride in the lead up to that, we had actually hired a consulting firm to perform our 2019 baseline kind of greenhouse gas footprint."
a,00:28:09.82 - 00:28:20.92,Um And in the process of kind of going setting up for two to propose are science based targets.
a,00:28:20.93 - 00:28:28.72,We started working with a second group called watershed which is more of like a platform to help measure.
a,00:28:29.25 - 00:28:34.16,So we've we've definitely put resources into like the measurement side.
a,00:28:34.17 - 00:28:59.84,"Um we're now working with with watershed on a kind of an ongoing basis um to perform our annual footprints, trying to really get a lot um closer and uh more, more real time as much as possible within that measurement and also build out tools to be able to project what um, what our emissions profile is going to be based on the decisions that we're making."
a,00:28:59.84 - 00:29:10.61,So one of the maybe interesting things about the apparel and footwear world is The decisions that we're making.
a,00:29:10.61 - 00:29:15.92,So we work basically a calendar year um ahead of time.
a,00:29:15.93 - 00:29:31.52,"So the product that we are designing and developing right now in August of 2022 is going to be the product that we're actually going to realize emissions for in August of 2023 um, and possibly even later."
a,00:29:31.76 - 00:29:52.52,"So we're trying to build with watershed a tool or a way to kind of get a sense of instead of looking backwards, doing like an annual review of the previous year's greenhouse gas footprint, how can we actually make better decisions today?"
a,00:29:52.53 - 00:29:56.06,Based on what we know our goals are set to be in the future.
a,00:29:56.07 - 00:29:58.47,So we know that we want to be at a certain place.
a,00:29:58.65 - 00:30:05.02,"Um, you know, by the end of 2025, just kind of directionally to show progress towards our 2030 goal."
a,00:30:05.03 - 00:30:16.48,"So like what do we need to do today, what do we need to be thinking about from a materials perspective from a manufacturing perspective, obviously logistics etc, like all of the decisions."
a,00:30:16.49 - 00:30:29.03,"Um, so that we can kind of get more of like more into the projecting um side of things rather than just like a retrospective analysis of our previous results."
a,00:30:29.04 - 00:30:49.08,So we're putting a lot of uh kind of human resources into that right now into thinking about how that would how that could just sort of manifest and be used as a tool and and also cross functionally as a as a tool for like a directional read on our climate goals.
a,00:30:49.09 - 00:30:57.19,Um But yeah we've we've done quite a bit of work especially for a company of our size in in in the C.T.
a,00:30:57.99 - 00:31:01.59,And what has the relationship with watershed been like?
a,00:31:01.59 - 00:31:12.71,Are they more on a consultant type of um feeling I guess um rather like or is it does it feel like they're part of your company?
a,00:31:12.72 - 00:31:24.01,"Um It doesn't feel like they're part of our company, it definitely is more like a consulting relationship but they've been really great and helpful."
a,00:31:24.01 - 00:31:33.50,So we were we were the for their first um kind of fashion company that signed onto their platforms.
a,00:31:33.50 - 00:31:54.30,"So the first year that we worked together with a lot, I mean we had weekly calls like um we really were helping them I think build what their dashboard and kind of back end system needed to look like and be and kind of compute for for our industry."
a,00:31:54.78 - 00:32:00.24,Um So that was a look that that's been you know a year in the making.
a,00:32:00.25 - 00:32:29.80,"Um and now we still, we now have bi weekly calls with them and we work very closely just to kind of continue both on the measurement side, but also on this this build out of this kind of special part of the tool that we really want to see um embedded in the platform, so um yeah, I guess it is more like a consultant consulting relationship and is there So you you've been you've submitted and it has been accepted your science-based target."
a,00:32:29.81 - 00:32:35.60,"And how do you, what's the process internally of uh reporting on how you're doing?"
a,00:32:35.61 - 00:32:46.09,"Um is it I believe it's like 20, and it's an organic cotton, I believe you said um like what is the process of reporting on that?"
a,00:32:46.75 - 00:33:03.41,"So for science based targets, um I think the requirement is that you just have to be publicly reporting what your your progress or your challenges whatever um on an annual basis in the format and venue of your choice."
a,00:33:03.42 - 00:33:08.67,So it's really open open ended from a company perspective as far as reporting goes.
a,00:33:08.68 - 00:33:11.76,Um This is also something new Forever Lane.
a,00:33:11.76 - 00:33:16.63,We we just published our first sustainability report in april of this year.
a,00:33:17.79 - 00:33:32.70,Um so this is going to be the kind of forum that we're going to continue to update our constituents um about our our greenhouse gas accounting um in our sustainability report.
a,00:33:32.70 - 00:33:44.53,So we we've now kind of aligned that all of our major initiatives were just going to ladder into this report um and we'll be publishing it on an annual basis.
a,00:33:44.54 - 00:34:03.11,"Um But then we also use our just like website as well, so we have kind of an offshoot landing page that's connected to our sustainability site um where we just talk about our science based targets and we try to break it down for anybody who wants to learn more."
a,00:34:03.88 - 00:34:07.96,Um So yeah that's that's kind of where we're reporting it right now.
a,00:34:07.97 - 00:34:25.50,"We're not we are not yet um disclosing to carbon disclosure project or um any other uh Yeah, I don't know reporting structures um Yeah, we're just trying to take like 11 step at a time."
a,00:34:25.51 - 00:34:54.67,"Yeah, it sounds great um Yeah, so we're getting closer to the top of the hour, is there in general in Korea whether ever lean or past um jobs, like what are some of the biggest challenges that you've seen faced in either measurement or like the management or reporting of um a sustainability um Just very loaded question but um anything that you want to share would be great."
a,00:34:54.67 - 00:35:01.05,I mean like what are just the biggest challenges you've seen or anything?
a,00:35:01.05 - 00:35:01.63,Yeah.
a,00:35:01.64 - 00:35:35.87,"Yeah, I think the biggest challenge, Well there are a lot of challenges I think um the first is that our systems don't always talk to one another, so we actually have quite a number of like pretty big work drivers that were working against um right now that would just be so seamlessly easy if our internal systems could kind of speak to these like external platforms um or at least push information into them."
a,00:35:35.88 - 00:35:44.86,Um I think that's a really big myths and that's just something that's kind of like a recurring theme.
a,00:35:44.86 - 00:35:57.80,"Those are also the projects that tend to take the most kind of upfront thought and preparation and and it's really something you have to build into, it's not something you can just like plug in and and have it seamlessly operate."
a,00:35:57.81 - 00:36:03.66,So um I would say at a Berlin we're a little behind on that front.
a,00:36:03.67 - 00:36:14.80,Um just having our our systems kind of be equipped to talk to others um And and vice versa have them have been talked to our systems as well.
a,00:36:15.40 - 00:36:35.06,"I think in in the kind of carbon accounting world there's always this push and pull between um you know using your using primary data and uh leveraging averages, regional country, you know, whatever specific averages."
a,00:36:35.07 - 00:36:54.98,"Um And this is a really hot topic in our industry right now, I'm not sure if you've been following some of the news but um there's the Hig platform has actually gotten some pretty big um backlash and write ups um for various various reasons, I think like generally L."
a,00:36:54.98 - 00:36:55.20,C.
a,00:36:55.20 - 00:36:59.38,"A methodology, databases that are either open or closed."
a,00:36:59.39 - 00:37:10.28,"Just an ongoing discussion of like how accurate are these values, especially from external forces kind of trying to poke in and poke holes."
a,00:37:10.29 - 00:37:16.67,"Um you know, I think in an ideal world we would all love to be using primary data."
a,00:37:16.68 - 00:37:21.55,"The uh the reality is like we just can't, it's not feasible."
a,00:37:21.55 - 00:37:29.56,"So we have to leverage some, you know, pro proxies where we, where we need to um and just have that as a directional read."
a,00:37:29.56 - 00:37:37.59,"So I'm not sure if there's as much pressure and maybe some other industries around this, but certainly in the, in the fashion world there is."
a,00:37:38.32 - 00:38:12.69,"Um, so there's, there's that concern and yeah, I still think, I think that there's just like a real um I don't know if it's a misunderstanding or a disconnect or what, but I think there's still just not a very strong understanding kind of broadly um of how, how the decisions we make, what the, what the product kind of makeup is, um, how that impacts what like an emissions profile can be."
a,00:38:12.69 - 00:38:31.63,"And I think emissions are actually one of the easier ones to understand whenever we start talking about water and chemistry it or like soil health, biodiversity, like all of these really big um topics that are so crucial and important are actually really difficult to kind of break down into sizable chunks."
a,00:38:31.90 - 00:38:36.48,Um and I think that's difficult for a customer perspective for sure.
a,00:38:36.49 - 00:38:56.31,"Um you know, whenever they're just looking to buy a new t shirt or a pair of jeans that fit um it's kind of hard to kind of make the jump to this like educational world where you're talking about like carbon footprint and, you know, soil microbiome health, like it's, it's just very complex and complicated."
a,00:38:56.49 - 00:39:09.09,"Um and it's even hard from an internal perspective to even at a company like ever lane where the population is super interested and they, they're hungry for information and they want to learn."
a,00:39:09.09 - 00:39:18.01,I think there's still a lot of just misunderstanding about what it means and what the right decisions are and how we kind of can get there.
a,00:39:18.02 - 00:39:32.64,"So, um, yeah, I don't know, I hope it, I hope it all becomes more part of the vernacular and just kind of a way of doing business, but we're definitely trying to build something, I think that doesn't exist most places."
a,00:39:32.64 - 00:39:35.30,And so that's really difficult.
a,00:39:36.06 - 00:39:36.58,Yeah.
a,00:39:36.59 - 00:39:44.81,"Yeah, but also there's a lot of action in that world at the moment and the carbon accounting software platforms."
a,00:39:44.82 - 00:39:51.76,"Yeah, it's watershed and a lot of other companies each have very specific ways of handling it."
a,00:39:51.77 - 00:39:53.96,Um so it's improving.
a,00:39:53.97 - 00:39:58.76,"Uh but yeah, is there anything this has been super helpful?"
a,00:39:58.77 - 00:40:09.24,"Um, your experience is very, very, um extends and it's been a great conversation for myself and I'm sure my colleague was taking notes as well."
a,00:40:09.25 - 00:40:22.17,"Is there anything else that you would want to share about, you know, any other challenges or anything and sustainability and like just the profession and where it's going and Yeah, sure."
a,00:40:22.17 - 00:40:31.93,"Yeah, I mean, I think um at least in the apparel industry, it seems to be a growth, it seems to be growing and kind of not stopping."
a,00:40:31.93 - 00:40:56.69,"I remember whenever I first um I started working in this industry, there were few and far between, I mean obviously like the big examples that everybody thinks about Patagonia Island fisher obviously have existed for a long time, but the amount of jobs just from like job searches that I saw back then compared to now is like mind blowing."
a,00:40:56.70 - 00:41:07.89,"Um so I definitely think that it seems like this is a growing kind of trend um which I think can only yield really positive results, I think."
a,00:41:07.90 - 00:41:48.61,"Um and I'm curious to know what you all are seeing as well in your research, but there's still, it still seems like we're all kind of occupying very small teams and team structures within organizations, even huge parent companies tend to have like much smaller uh sustainability teams compared to others, um although there is still quite a lot of, you know, metrics and analysis and strategizing, like there's still quite a lot of complexity in the work that we do, but we just sort of have to be jacks of all trades for a long time until the size of our teams can grow."
a,00:41:48.62 - 00:42:29.91,"Um So I don't know, it's, I think maybe the next horizon or at least what I'm hoping is, you know, not everybody can kind of be the sustainability person or people in a company, but um hopefully there's you know, more education or at least more of a path to education for these types of topics within like specific trades or studies, so um I don't know, so they're a little sustainability advocates who are, you know, joining out of college to work in product development and they have a background and understanding similarly to what you would for like general accounting or or like finance."
a,00:42:29.92 - 00:43:25.48,"Um So I don't know, I haven't really seen that, I've seen a lot of big explosion in um people who are like traditionally educated or trained on these subjects who are coming in to kind of set the strategic goals um for companies generally, but not as much um you know, sustainability being like part of an education across other uh Yeah, that's actually a theme that I keep hearing and it's not all of our research at all, like we're we work on like right now we're working on auditing platform, we're looking to incorporate um ways to manage your science based targets, but everyone that I've spoken to has said something along the lines of like how it needs to become more part of the business and so it was really interesting to hear that your leadership has kpi s attached to sustainability."
a,00:43:25.67 - 00:43:45.19,"Um But I think yeah that's kind of what every company is gonna, you know, eventually it will, it's kind of like a thing now and eventually it will disappear and it will become something that we all do and attached to all of our KPI s and all of our professionals, no matter what role you have."
a,00:43:46.26 - 00:43:49.39,"Yeah, well that's certainly what we're trying to do."
a,00:43:49.39 - 00:44:00,"But um again, ever Lynn is kind of a special place and we're we're also not like governed by um you know, we're not publicly traded."
a,00:44:00 - 00:44:06.09,"So I don't think we have a lot of the same pressure um to deliver on, you know, whatever."
a,00:44:06.10 - 00:44:12.27,"Um But yeah, I don't know, it's it's interesting, it's an interesting time."
a,00:44:12.27 - 00:44:14.61,"I think we're seeing a lot of progress, which is really cool."
a,00:44:14.62 - 00:44:15.73,Yeah.
a,00:44:15.74 - 00:44:21.50,"Yeah, I'll let you get back to your day and I hope you feel better."
a,00:44:21.50 - 00:44:26.34,"This has been super helpful, thank you so much for your time and Yeah, no worries."
a,00:44:26.35 - 00:44:27.74,Happy to talk with you.
a,00:44:27.75 - 00:44:32.67,Are you all going to be publishing something or is this more just for internal research?
a,00:44:32.68 - 00:44:34.34,The research is internal.
a,00:44:34.35 - 00:44:38.10,"Um Yeah, we were not publishing anything."
a,00:44:38.11 - 00:44:42.40,"Our platform is at, our website has sustained that life."
a,00:44:42.41 - 00:44:46.05,Um We we have some screenshots.
a,00:44:46.06 - 00:44:55.71,"Um I believe, yeah, you can, if you are interested in getting more information, you could schedule a demo or I could connect you to that person myself."
a,00:44:55.72 - 00:45:00.44,"Um you know, I don't want to do any type of sales."
a,00:45:00.45 - 00:46:01.77,"No, no, it it might be interesting at some point maybe I don't know where in like your iteration um you're at, but I think we're always really intrigued to just kind of like learn what's out there and understand um you know what various platforms or partnerships would both cost us, but also afford us in in these big goals that we have, and I think a common theme is just like trying to um remove complexities for everybody um and so if we can use tools or platforms or software or whatever to kind of help us do that, then that's obviously really great, but okay, um so if I introduce you to someone via email, that's okay and Yeah, okay, cool, I'll find out who to connect you with and yeah, we have a lot of different things that you touched on, so they'll be able to help you out."
a,00:46:01.78 - 00:46:02.41,Cool.
a,00:46:02.42 - 00:46:04.92,"Yeah, well, thank you so much."
a,00:46:05.72 - 00:46:06.50,Alright.
a,00:46:06.83 - 00:46:07.54,You too.
a,00:46:07.55 - 00:46:08.30,Bye.
b,timecode,transcript
b,00:00:00.00 - 00:00:01.42,sounds very official.
b,00:00:01.43 - 00:00:05.02,This session is now being recorded Alright.
b,00:00:05.03 - 00:00:08.19,"Very official, very official."
b,00:00:08.20 - 00:00:25.86,Um Okay so we are working on some research with consultants as well as um in house sustainability professionals to improve our products and um I'm a senior product designer here.
b,00:00:25.87 - 00:00:36.86,I basically have been talking to a lot of different people and well you know it helps us gain information to make our products better so there's no right or wrong answers.
b,00:00:36.87 - 00:00:45.22,"Um it's you know, your experience, that's a valuable thing here and usually we we take about 45 minutes."
b,00:00:45.23 - 00:00:53.17,"Um I booked for an hour but it doesn't have to be 45 you know, it's whenever we have like a good conversation around then."
b,00:00:53.18 - 00:01:19.59,"Um Well I'm gonna ask you questions about just high level general like how you got started and then we can talk about more specific tasks you have issues with that you would love like software solutions for but yeah, before you know I keep going um it would be great to hear about your experience and and how you got into carbon accounting and sustainability."
b,00:01:20.16 - 00:01:20.97,Sure.
b,00:01:20.98 - 00:01:22.48,So my name is name-extracted.
b,00:01:22.48 - 00:01:24.81,I'm a senior associate here at company-name-extracted.
b,00:01:24.82 - 00:01:26.79,We are a full service E.S.G. Uh consultancy firm.
b,00:01:29.96 - 00:01:41.28,"So we do everything from the more qualitative report writing gap analysis, materiality assessments all the way to the more technical side of things which involves mainly carbon accounting which is what I do."
b,00:01:41.29 - 00:01:52.34,Um I joined company-name-extracted after previously being at a firm that specialized in um third party assurance and verification.
b,00:01:52.35 - 00:02:01.84,"So primarily over carbon greenhouse gas emissions data, but we also touched on like water and waste and DNA metrics as well."
b,00:02:01.85 - 00:02:11.76,Um but that really allowed me to get a a lot of exposure to a lot of different industries and how they all tackled their various unique issues when it came to carbon accounting.
b,00:02:11.77 - 00:02:12.78,Prior to that.
b,00:02:12.79 - 00:02:21.99,"Um My Master's degree, my Master's degree was actually from Colorado state in greenhouse gas, so very specific to the, to the work that I'm doing now."
b,00:02:21.99 - 00:02:24.20,"So I'm pretty, I'm pretty lucky that this job exists."
b,00:02:24.21 - 00:02:51.92,"Um and then prior to that, prior to that I my undergraduate degree in environmental science and so really if you want to start the first thing I, the first time I ever really uh um got any experience with carbon accounting at all was doing research on permafrost carbon in Alaska and how that is affecting the carbon cycle and how permafrost thaw is exposing more carbon to be to be um to be released."
b,00:02:51.93 - 00:02:54.57,So kind of that was a backwards looking way.
b,00:02:54.57 - 00:02:57,"But yeah, started from an environmental science perspective."
b,00:02:57.01 - 00:02:58.93,Um kind of moved into it.
b,00:02:58.94 - 00:03:11.11,"Um looking at inventories on all different levels, even from national government level inventories in some my graduate work and then moving towards the corporate side of things."
b,00:03:11.12 - 00:03:12.37,Um after I graduated.
b,00:03:12.38 - 00:03:22.79,"So yeah that's my background um we do inventories for companies that are either, they're really early on in the process taking their first steps."
b,00:03:22.79 - 00:03:28.61,"They maybe they don't have a program at all yet, or companies that have been doing this for a few years and they just want to make things better."
b,00:03:28.61 - 00:03:31.70,"They're ready to expand to scope three, they're ready to set targets."
b,00:03:31.71 - 00:03:39.08,Um That kind of thing is that um does that tend to be very tailored for the customer?
b,00:03:39.08 - 00:03:41.54,Like how does how does the project begin?
b,00:03:41.55 - 00:03:44.84,"Yeah, so it really does depend on the customer's needs."
b,00:03:44.85 - 00:03:57.14,"Um like I said, if, if we just take an example of some customer, a customer who has never done any greenhouse gas accounting before and they've never done that, this is the first year inventory."
b,00:03:57.15 - 00:04:01.81,Um it really starts by understanding their business and understanding which sources we need to look at.
b,00:04:01.81 - 00:04:12.55,"So that boundary setting step is um, is one of the trickier parts of the process, but definitely one of the more important understanding, okay, which locations do we need to look at?"
b,00:04:12.55 - 00:04:14.51,What sources do we need to be looking for?
b,00:04:14.51 - 00:04:20.58,"Some some clients are very straightforward in which they, okay, we only have leased office space in buildings."
b,00:04:20.58 - 00:04:23.23,"We that's it, that's our, that's our physical footprint."
b,00:04:23.23 - 00:04:24.99,We don't even have a vehicle fleet.
b,00:04:25 - 00:04:34.30,"Um, so those are a lot more straightforward than maybe a hypothetical manufacturing client where they have manufacturing facilities, they burn a lot of fuel."
b,00:04:34.31 - 00:04:42.08,"Maybe they have a vehicle fleet, maybe they have um, some potential fugitive emissions um from their processes."
b,00:04:42.09 - 00:04:49.02,"Um and then, so really it starts with understanding each client what their, what their specific needs are."
b,00:04:49.03 - 00:05:16.21,"Um and then, and then we move into kind of the data collection phase, which as I'm sure you're aware is oftentimes the most challenging, especially especially for clients who have never done this before, collecting data is oftentimes, especially the first time around, usually always a pretty big headache because so I mean some clients have the more established clients of, okay, we have processes in place when we pay our bills, we track our electricity usage as well."
b,00:05:16.22 - 00:05:20.94,"Maybe they use a bill pay service, like energy or someone like that, That makes things a lot easier."
b,00:05:20.95 - 00:05:24.37,"But unfortunately those are few and far between most of the time, it's okay?"
b,00:05:24.38 - 00:05:32.11,"We need to go to our actual locations, go back in time for the years that we're looking to do this inventory for actually collect the data?"
b,00:05:32.12 - 00:05:37.50,Um That a lot of times and that requires like working with company context to understand.
b,00:05:37.50 - 00:05:41.20,"Okay, who, who has access to this data, where does it sit?"
b,00:05:41.21 - 00:05:45.35,Um That's often times the most time consuming part of the process.
b,00:05:45.36 - 00:05:46.77,Yeah.
b,00:05:46.78 - 00:05:57.14,"And do you find that the data is consistent throughout, like, let's talk about manufacturing and like support chain and all of that."
b,00:05:57.15 - 00:06:02.52,"Um Like what I've heard before, is that data comes in all different formats."
b,00:06:02.53 - 00:06:09.50,"Is that something that you experience, Do you guys have any sort of process around that cleaning it up and making it consistent?"
b,00:06:09.51 - 00:06:13.11,"Yeah, it definitely comes in all different formats depending on the location."
b,00:06:13.12 - 00:06:25.99,"If we're just talking about scope one and scope to data usually that's fairly simple enough to to bring together, although it's a little tedious because it normally comes in just okay, this is our electricity bill is their natural gas bill."
b,00:06:25.99 - 00:06:32.58,"We just have to kind of pull the units off that unless they have a centralized system which like I said, it's few and far between."
b,00:06:32.59 - 00:06:43.97,"If they do have a centralized system we can run an export and say, okay, what's the usage for all of these sites over the time period we're looking at but then thinking about supply changes in scope three, that's when it gets a lot more inconsistent."
b,00:06:43.98 - 00:06:57.98,Different companies have different ways of tracking or different levels of tracking um The data that we need a lot of the times for scope three assessments were really starting with kind of that spend based data as part of the initial screening to determine.
b,00:06:57.98 - 00:06:58.17,Okay.
b,00:06:58.17 - 00:07:03.56,Which which categories are most relevant material to that company?
b,00:07:03.57 - 00:07:17.87,"Um And then when we want to move on to more more advanced calculations for things like purchase goods and services, things like downstream transportation, distribution, that's where the data is kind of all over the place depending on the client."
b,00:07:17.87 - 00:07:18.27,"Right, okay."
b,00:07:18.27 - 00:07:39.85,"One client may track, we've shipped, we know we've shipped this money units to this location and it went by rail or for example like that but it's really inconsistent I think and I think part of the problem is that only only the companies that are like the furthest along have really established systems to track that kind of information."
b,00:07:39.86 - 00:07:49.08,Um These I mean and that's talking about a hypothetical client that makes like a physical product for scope three other clients.
b,00:07:49.08 - 00:07:51.65,When you're thinking about scope three their biggest sources.
b,00:07:51.65 - 00:08:02.05,"Or maybe it's maybe it's business travel, maybe it's just produce goods and services, employee commuting and business travel is one of the ones that a lot of clients like to start with just because the data is the most available for it."
b,00:08:02.06 - 00:08:08.03,"And they can, I think they can conceptually understand where the emissions come from when it comes to business travel."
b,00:08:08.03 - 00:08:10.49,"Like they understand, okay, flying on a plane produces emissions."
b,00:08:10.78 - 00:08:17.61,Um some of the other categories are a little more nebulous and they require a little more explanation for them to get it to get why we're collecting it.
b,00:08:17.62 - 00:08:28.99,"Um But yeah, it's definitely that's definitely an issue is okay all the different formats the data comes in and and it's really a fairly manual process to try to get it in the right format that we need."
b,00:08:29 - 00:08:31.62,Um in order to do the calculations on it.
b,00:08:31.63 - 00:08:32.58,Yeah.
b,00:08:32.59 - 00:08:45.74,"And you also mentioned, you mentioned like the business travel is easy for customers to understand what's a not easy want to understand and like what kind of do you have to share resources with them is it?"
b,00:08:45.74 - 00:08:47.22,Like an education?
b,00:08:47.23 - 00:08:58.40,"Yeah, sometimes like I think they call clients here scope three and they're like okay, we know we have to do scope three but a lot of times they don't know what the different scope three categories are."
b,00:08:58.41 - 00:09:02.16,They also don't know where the boundaries begin and end for scope three.
b,00:09:02.17 - 00:09:09.06,"Um I think you have sold products is definitely something that people struggle with, especially if they don't make like a physical product, right?"
b,00:09:09.06 - 00:09:17.10,"If if they make a physical products a lot easier to understand, which is really what the protocol is designed to like, that's what is written around."
b,00:09:17.11 - 00:09:25.75,"It's like a hypothetical product that uses energy um some of those indirect emissions that are optional and then clients are like okay, do we have to account for?"
b,00:09:27.10 - 00:09:38.63,"Um I'm trying to think of a good example of a category they don't really understand, they don't understand um the fuel and energy related activities category because I need to, that's usually more of an education process."
b,00:09:38.63 - 00:09:48.90,"Understanding okay, what transmission and distribution losses are why there are emissions upstream for when the fuel to produce electricity is extracted, that kind of thing."
b,00:09:48.91 - 00:09:53.95,Um purchase goods and services often sometimes takes a little bit of explanation.
b,00:09:53.96 - 00:10:00.98,"Okay, the things that you buy have embodied emissions because they took emissions they took energy to produce."
b,00:10:00.99 - 00:10:06.86,"Um So yeah, there's definitely an education component when it comes to each scope three category."
b,00:10:06.87 - 00:10:11.64,And I think the big question is like okay which of these do we have to account for?
b,00:10:11.65 - 00:10:12.99,And then like what's the limit?
b,00:10:13 - 00:10:14.81,What's the boundary on these categories?
b,00:10:14.81 - 00:10:17.28,How far down the chain do we need to go?
b,00:10:17.29 - 00:10:22.74,Um A lot of like I said it's easier with clients that make a physical product.
b,00:10:22.75 - 00:10:25.04,I think that's it's a lot more straightforward clients.
b,00:10:25.05 - 00:10:39.40,"Yeah with clients that are like um like financial services clients, they're really struggling with the especially because the methodology for category 15 investments category is there's still so many different methodologies out there for calculating that."
b,00:10:39.41 - 00:10:42.73,Um They're like okay what do we need to include?
b,00:10:42.73 - 00:10:54.88,And I think there's some some things that are lost in translation when comparing the language of how financial services discuss their different different types of investments versus how the G.
b,00:10:54.88 - 00:10:56.13,Protocol discusses it.
b,00:10:56.14 - 00:10:58.08,Um So that's a little bit of a trance.
b,00:10:58.09 - 00:11:06.39,Like that's a that's a hard exercise into into their terminology right into language they understand.
b,00:11:06.40 - 00:11:08.48,Um Yeah it's hard.
b,00:11:08.69 - 00:11:12.41,Yeah I've heard that a lot like everyone has their own version of that.
b,00:11:12.41 - 00:11:15.26,It's like talking to marketing or talking to these people.
b,00:11:15.27 - 00:11:27.52,"It's like a lot of Yeah especially because there's so many different data sources across the company, like so many different departments in a company need to be involved in a complete like if you're doing like a complete scope, three inventory?"
b,00:11:27.53 - 00:11:28.85,You understand?
b,00:11:28.85 - 00:11:33.65,Okay accounting is involved for the spend data but then facilities involved.
b,00:11:33.66 - 00:11:38.45,"Okay do we have any like leased assets or where do we send our, where are all our products going?"
b,00:11:38.46 - 00:11:53.83,They take so many different sides of the company to do a full inventory That um getting everyone to talk in the same language is sometimes difficult but that's also part of like okay learning the company itself and understanding what what they do.
b,00:11:54.93 - 00:11:55.88,Yeah.
b,00:11:55.89 - 00:12:01.03,Um And you also mentioned that you do party auditing.
b,00:12:01.04 - 00:12:04.92,Is that yeah we do verification and assurance over over some clients.
b,00:12:04.92 - 00:12:14.27,That was my we do we do some um prior with a firm called Apex um Who did exclusively we didn't do any consulting.
b,00:12:14.27 - 00:12:16.52,We exclusively did verification and assurance.
b,00:12:16.53 - 00:12:30.64,"Um So that's a that's a different kind of engagement where that's more we're following a pretty strict protocol in order to check their emissions calculations, check that background data."
b,00:12:30.65 - 00:12:37.69,Um That's really something that we see clients that are more that are further along in the process go for.
b,00:12:37.69 - 00:12:40.10,Maybe they've been doing their inventory for a few years.
b,00:12:40.11 - 00:12:45.73,They feel pretty good about their methodology so then they were like okay we want third party assurance of it.
b,00:12:45.73 - 00:12:52.03,And so it's we're checking sampling of the source data that they're using their calculation methods.
b,00:12:52.03 - 00:12:53.70,The actual calculation numbers themselves.
b,00:12:53.70 - 00:12:55.19,The roll ups that kind of thing.
b,00:12:55.20 - 00:13:14.59,"Um Yeah is that a fairly manual process like you know you want to check specific calculation and then you like go into your own software or like Yeah, so it depends on the software that the client is using for their um For their inventory somewhere."
b,00:13:14.59 - 00:13:15.16,Just a lot.
b,00:13:15.16 - 00:13:17.06,Most are just doing it in Excel still.
b,00:13:17.07 - 00:13:19.32,Um and so that is really just okay.
b,00:13:19.32 - 00:13:20.66,We will check.
b,00:13:20.67 - 00:13:25.01,I'll take they so they'll they'll have acclaimed emissions total.
b,00:13:25.02 - 00:13:26.47,So I'll take like a subset.
b,00:13:26.47 - 00:13:32.16,"Okay, they say for this office, this is the total amount of emissions, this is the total amount of electricity usage."
b,00:13:32.16 - 00:13:40.46,"I'll do my own calculations to say, Okay, does that match up we have a materiality threshold, like plus or -5% of the whole scope that we work on?"
b,00:13:40.90 - 00:13:43.25,Um The that's fairly manual.
b,00:13:43.25 - 00:13:46.32,"I mean, it depends if they're using like online carbon accounting platform."
b,00:13:46.32 - 00:13:53.73,"Sometimes it can actually be a little more difficult to check those calculations because in Excel they're very visible, right?"
b,00:13:53.73 - 00:13:56,"You can click on a cell, see where things are coming from."
b,00:13:56.01 - 00:13:59.88,Um but they're a little more opaque on an online carbon couching platform.
b,00:13:59.89 - 00:14:15.16,"Um but then the other part of what we do is we review a selection of like documentation for background data that was like, okay, you claim you used 100,000 kilowatt hours here."
b,00:14:16.03 - 00:14:17.26,Where can you prove that?
b,00:14:17.26 - 00:14:18.57,Can we see the invoices for that?
b,00:14:18.57 - 00:14:22.13,"Or can we see a report from, your utility provider saying this is how much energy used."
b,00:14:22.14 - 00:14:41.63,"and so in that case is when they're using an online platform, it's usually a little easier because they have the opportunity to attach evidence to particular like items so we can go in so we have to request less from the actual client and sometimes if we're trying to get those electricity bills, it's back and forth with a particular office or with the utility provider that takes some time."
b,00:14:41.64 - 00:14:50.74,"But if they've uploaded that evidence to a system, it's, it's a little more straightforward for us to go and say, okay, we can see for january at this location, this is the electricity usage."
b,00:14:50.75 - 00:14:51.60,Right.
b,00:14:52.57 - 00:14:53.05,Yeah.
b,00:14:53.06 - 00:15:02.43,"And what are some of the common challenges in auditing um when you go back and forth, what what are those back and forth?"
b,00:15:03.43 - 00:15:34.54,"Um I think like I said a lot of it is okay, this is the data like this is the data we need um that's what takes a lot of the time is okay actually getting some of the source data, I think a lot of companies don't have a, I really flushed out inventory management plan for example, where they describe the exact methodology of their calculations and the exact methodology of how they collect their data in the few instances where I've worked with clients that do have that."
b,00:15:34.55 - 00:15:40.20,"It really helps the auditing process because we can understand, okay, this is where that data is coming from."
b,00:15:40.21 - 00:15:47.08,"This is how, if there's any QA QC procedures, this is what they are um and then this is how the calculation is done."
b,00:15:47.08 - 00:15:53.54,These are the emission factors we use having something like a document like that that's laid out is really helpful um but it's not very common.
b,00:15:53.55 - 00:15:55.55,"Okay, that's what we're working on."
b,00:15:55.56 - 00:15:57.26,Yeah.
b,00:15:57.27 - 00:15:58.42,"Yeah, no that's definitely great."
b,00:15:58.42 - 00:16:24.42,"Like understanding like this is the methodology, this is this is the process and procedures is like something that at the beginning of an audit is always super helpful to read through it because it just that would reduce the number of questions that I have for the client right the back and forth a lot of the times like looking at it from a third party perspective, you'll have questions that are really not, it's really not an issue, not a verification issue."
b,00:16:24.43 - 00:16:26.60,It's really just something that needs to be explained.
b,00:16:26.61 - 00:16:35.45,Um and so it's a quick back and forth but having having that that methodology like laid out in front of you can reduce the number of back and forth.
b,00:16:35.45 - 00:16:36.87,You need to have great.
b,00:16:36.88 - 00:16:47.23,"Um So aside from auditing you also you know, back to the client work and the measurement and all of that."
b,00:16:47.24 - 00:17:00.70,Um is there any interest in having some sort of like science based targets package or I don't know like is there any specific things that you do for that initiative?
b,00:17:01.21 - 00:17:05.67,Yeah for science based targets that's usually that we go through that process quite a bit.
b,00:17:05.68 - 00:17:12.19,"It's a pretty common ask once once companies have been doing their inventory for a few years, they're looking to set targets."
b,00:17:12.20 - 00:17:22.81,Um And it's becoming less common for companies just but I think a few years ago companies would just pick up either pick an arbitrary number or pick something that they thought they could achieve and set that target.
b,00:17:23.09 - 00:17:28.33,Now there's a lot more interest in science space targets having that approved.
b,00:17:28.34 - 00:17:49.09,So when we go through that process um often times it's kind of in combination with a with a scope three screening because they want to know if okay if their scope three emissions are greater than 40% they have to set a scope three science based targets and sometimes the people interested haven't haven't completed their full scope three inventory yet.
b,00:17:49.10 - 00:17:55.21,"Um So that's the first part is like okay, scope three screening determine if they need to set a scope three target."
b,00:17:55.22 - 00:18:00.57,Usually in almost all cases it's yes because scope three emissions are so much bigger than scope one and two.
b,00:18:00.58 - 00:18:18.75,Um but then it's really about they clients want to either either they'll commit immediately and then they'll say okay we have two years to figure it out or they really want to understand their target options before they even commit publicly to setting them.
b,00:18:18.76 - 00:18:24.71,So what we'll do is take their emissions inventory and model out most commonly used.
b,00:18:24.71 - 00:18:25.30,We'll use the S.B.T.I.
b,00:18:25.65 - 00:18:27.71,Tools to model out.
b,00:18:27.71 - 00:18:30.03,Okay these are your potential targets right?
b,00:18:30.03 - 00:18:33.80,If you set a absolute emissions target it looks like this.
b,00:18:33.80 - 00:18:38.98,If you set the intensity target it looks like this back when to under two degrees C.
b,00:18:38.98 - 00:18:40.15,And 1.5 degrees C.
b,00:18:40.15 - 00:18:40.88,Targets were allowed.
b,00:18:40.88 - 00:18:43.72,We would model at both those different pathways and show them the difference.
b,00:18:43.73 - 00:18:46.10,Now it has to be below 1.5 degrees C.
b,00:18:46.10 - 00:18:50.99,So we'll model out both of those different pathways and then a lot of clients won't understand.
b,00:18:50.99 - 00:18:55.27,"Okay so this is a hypothetical target, is it achievable for us?"
b,00:18:55.28 - 00:19:08.55,So well okay if you um if you purchased all this renewable energy where would that put you on in relation to your goal if you covered all your electricity with renewables for example.
b,00:19:08.56 - 00:19:19.83,Um So then it's more okay then they will publicly commit and then we'll go through the more formal target setting process which is a little more rigorous in terms of science based targets will come back and ask questions about.
b,00:19:19.83 - 00:19:22.84,Okay how did you do your inventory?
b,00:19:22.84 - 00:19:25.36,Did you account for this particular thing and scope three?
b,00:19:25.37 - 00:19:28.09,So that's more of a back and forth with the science based targets group.
b,00:19:28.10 - 00:19:32.12,Um But yeah so that's kind of an overview of the process there?
b,00:19:32.13 - 00:19:38.52,Um And it is with the science based targets tools are are great to a degree.
b,00:19:38.53 - 00:19:50.07,Sometimes it's a little confusing that their their version numbers are they like they'll have multiple versions up that exist on the internet and if you're using like an outdated version you gotta be careful because it won't it won't give you the same math.
b,00:19:50.08 - 00:20:03.04,Um but we'll we'll check it internally with our with our with our own calculations because usually those Percentage reductions are pretty straightforward and we can just say Oh it's 4.2% each year or something like that.
b,00:20:03.05 - 00:20:12.57,Occasionally clients will want to be more aggressive than the actual what the tool spits out as they're like minimum pathway for 1.5 degrees C.
b,00:20:12.58 - 00:20:15.80,Um So well we'll adjust that as well.
b,00:20:15.81 - 00:20:17.09,Yeah.
b,00:20:17.10 - 00:20:26.46,Um And what is like what is that conversation with um the client and them getting buy in from their organization or do you not?
b,00:20:26.47 - 00:20:28.82,Are you not as involved in that part?
b,00:20:28.83 - 00:20:33.89,Usually usually they come to us when they already have buying to set a target.
b,00:20:33.90 - 00:20:37.34,However sometimes it's something that comes up.
b,00:20:37.35 - 00:20:41.49,Say we're doing an initial scope three or scope one and two inventory.
b,00:20:41.49 - 00:20:44.61,Maybe some scope three part of our recommendations.
b,00:20:44.62 - 00:20:52.11,"We always provide recommendations at the end of the project things to think about, oh this is this is where you could potentially look to look reduce your emissions."
b,00:20:52.12 - 00:20:57.83,You should consider setting a target and usually our suggestion is to point them towards the science based targets as best practice.
b,00:20:57.84 - 00:21:11.77,Um Occasionally they've they've looked at that and they say this makes sense for us but really um yeah if they trust our advice coming out of the initial inventory and we say we think science based targets are best practice.
b,00:21:11.78 - 00:21:14.11,Occasionally they'll say yes let's do it.
b,00:21:14.12 - 00:21:30.45,Sometimes it needs to come from higher up um to get by and maybe they're getting pressure um from investors or things like that to set rates or um or from or we're seeing slightly more and more supply chain connections right?
b,00:21:30.45 - 00:21:37.24,"For for maybe some of their customers, their biggest customers, their biggest suppliers want their value chain to have targets set."
b,00:21:37.25 - 00:21:40.16,So that occasionally will be a motivator as well.
b,00:21:40.81 - 00:21:41.72,Yeah.
b,00:21:41.73 - 00:21:48.21,And are the are the tools that you have to use per client?
b,00:21:48.22 - 00:21:51.58,Um You know like do they change at all?
b,00:21:51.59 - 00:21:55.09,Um What is the biggest challenge with science based targets?
b,00:21:55.10 - 00:22:00.36,Because often what I hear is that it's the same challenges as everything else?
b,00:22:00.36 - 00:22:01.50,Like it's the data really.
b,00:22:01.50 - 00:22:08.14,But is there any specific um Any specific tools that you use for this process?
b,00:22:08.15 - 00:22:09.16,Yeah.
b,00:22:09.17 - 00:22:18.59,"I think there's not really, not really any tools, I think the process is slightly different just depending on the client, depending what what scope three categories are material to them."
b,00:22:18.59 - 00:22:32.42,"Scope one and 2 is usually pretty straight forward, no matter what it's like the sci fi target tool is gonna spit out A potential target that that meets their criteria that's below 1.5°C pathway."
b,00:22:32.43 - 00:22:44.10,"Thinking about the script targets Are a little more if you're not looking into the net zero guidance, which some clients are looking at like long-term net zero targets for like 2050 or earlier."
b,00:22:44.11 - 00:22:51.83,Those have to they expand that boundary that you have to cover 90% of your scope three emissions or 95%.
b,00:22:51.84 - 00:22:53.25,I can't remember off the top of my head.
b,00:22:53.94 - 00:23:07.41,"Um but the scope three targets for Like the near-term targets or the medium-term targets that are like 10 years out, they don't have to cover that much of your scope three emissions."
b,00:23:07.41 - 00:23:16.19,So some some companies and you can see this on the science-based target website will set a sense we target only over a certain category of their scope three.
b,00:23:16.20 - 00:23:24.67,So that's really where it gets more customized depending on the client is the scope three target and the potential for that um scope one and two is usually more straightforward.
b,00:23:24.67 - 00:23:31.42,"But yeah, I think If they have a scope on into inventory and it's completed that target setting process is fairly straightforward."
b,00:23:31.43 - 00:23:38.75,"It is when it gets comes to scope three, it's really determining some some clients are like, Okay, are we above or below that 40% threshold."
b,00:23:38.75 - 00:23:43.75,That means we have to set a scope to target and then once they say they're above it.
b,00:23:43.75 - 00:23:43.97,Okay.
b,00:23:43.97 - 00:23:46.07,Which which combination of categories?
b,00:23:46.71 - 00:23:50.41,I think it's about 60% of the scripture emissions have to be included in the target.
b,00:23:50.42 - 00:23:53.45,So which combination of categories do we need to set a target on?
b,00:23:53.46 - 00:23:58.75,Can we set a target just on 11 category.
b,00:23:58.75 - 00:24:03.51,For example if they have one category that really dominates their um their scope three emissions.
b,00:24:03.51 - 00:24:09.74,So that's where it gets a little more a little more difficult and a little more customized depending on the client.
b,00:24:09.74 - 00:24:11.34,And there's not really a tool that we use.
b,00:24:11.34 - 00:24:13.79,It's kind of just math um to determine.
b,00:24:13.79 - 00:24:14.08,Okay.
b,00:24:14.10 - 00:24:18.19,"Does they, do they are they meeting the threshold if they include these categories?"
b,00:24:18.19 - 00:24:24.97,"Are they meeting the threshold if they're only setting a target on, you know, just 13 category?"
b,00:24:24.98 - 00:24:25.98,Yeah.
b,00:24:25.99 - 00:24:46.08,And within your own company and colleagues um is it do you guys often have the same client or is it an autonomous thing where like I'm working on this client or is it more of like usually it's a team um there'll be a team of associates and a couple analysts on each client engagement.
b,00:24:46.09 - 00:24:58.18,"Um But these are you the science based target process is usually part of a bigger scope of work that we have for a client, usually there's other things happening in parallel at the same time but that maybe other members of my company are working on."
b,00:24:58.19 - 00:25:06.18,"Um Yeah, so it's it's really not like one person going off and setting a target for someone is really a team thing."
b,00:25:06.19 - 00:25:07.21,Yeah.
b,00:25:07.22 - 00:25:08.91,How do you guys collaborate?
b,00:25:08.91 - 00:25:40.74,"Like and how Yeah, I mean I think it's it's mostly about I mean it's just about communicating with each other and like I said okay you can use the science based targets tool tool to model out their potential scope one and two targets and you can use it to model their potential school three and then we kind of we usually bring them together in some form of presentation slides to show them okay these are your target options and will work collaboratively collaboratively in those slides usually power point."
b,00:25:40.75 - 00:25:56.59,"Um I don't think there's any good I mean Excel obviously we're using to do something, do the calculations um and then we'll maybe we'll write up a report and say okay these are your missions these your target options, that kind of thing."
b,00:25:57.15 - 00:25:57.74,Yeah.
b,00:25:58.35 - 00:25:58.99,Cool.
b,00:25:59 - 00:26:11.62,So overall in like your work and your company um what are some of the bigger challenges that you face that you know that we could be helpful in with like software tools?
b,00:26:11.62 - 00:26:21.03,So we have larger men were working on a lot of things and we're trying to work more specifically with um creating tools for consultants.
b,00:26:21.04 - 00:26:31.07,Um So what what do you see out there in the world challenges like not specific features that you need but just like I think the biggest challenge.
b,00:26:31.07 - 00:26:42.90,And this is something we talked we just we touched on briefly is that data collection side of things for the client to to really if if a client doesn't have a centralized system where they're tracking all of these different information that we need?
b,00:26:42.90 - 00:26:50.36,"It's hard to build that uh for each, each individual client because every client system systems are kind of different."
b,00:26:50.37 - 00:26:56.45,Um I know there's progress made on this with the ability to connect to some systems with a P.I.S
b,00:26:56.87 - 00:26:58.79,Or other other things like that.
b,00:26:58.80 - 00:27:13.68,"I think just it's almost more like okay in educating educating the clients that, so this is to make them understand that this is information that needs to be tracked year over year or even like month to month and have that all in one central location."
b,00:27:13.69 - 00:27:29.07,"I think that's the biggest challenge that we deal with is really they sometimes they'll they'll do, they'll do an inventory, they'll get us all the data for one year and then they'll they'll maybe forget about it for a whole another year until they're ready to do it again."
b,00:27:29.08 - 00:27:31.71,And that's really not the most efficient way to collect this data.
b,00:27:31.71 - 00:27:33.55,It really should be an ongoing process.
b,00:27:33.56 - 00:27:36.32,Um That's the biggest challenge.
b,00:27:36.32 - 00:27:41.14,I think another one is potentially the boundary setting.
b,00:27:41.15 - 00:27:49.37,"Um discussions, clients really don't understand the difference between the different control approaches that the GsC protocol uses."
b,00:27:49.37 - 00:27:53.20,So like operational control financial control equity share approach.
b,00:27:53.21 - 00:27:59.98,They're also really concerned about the sec has proposed climate rule and what that means for setting their boundaries.
b,00:27:59.99 - 00:28:13.61,"I think in the climate rule it might have, we'll see when it finally comes when the final version comes out, but are they going to need to align their greenhouse gas emission boundaries with their financial reporting boundaries like they have in their in their 10-K.S."
b,00:28:13.91 - 00:28:16.29,Um So that's that's another one.
b,00:28:16.29 - 00:28:17.87,So data collection and the boundary setting.
b,00:28:17.88 - 00:28:20.10,Our two big ones I think.
b,00:28:20.59 - 00:28:26.64,Do you provide any sort of templates or any spreadsheets that they can get started on?
b,00:28:26.64 - 00:28:27.21,Like when?
b,00:28:27.22 - 00:28:36.36,"Yeah, we usually we'll send them a data collection spreadsheet after we if we if we know okay there's this many locations and they all use, we won't understand."
b,00:28:36.36 - 00:28:37.89,"Okay, do they use electricity?"
b,00:28:37.89 - 00:28:47.31,Do they use natural gas will send kind of a either a Excel template or that they can fill out and then return to us.
b,00:28:47.97 - 00:28:54.14,"Which is great when they do a lot of times they don't do that, they just send back the bills and they make us pull out the information."
b,00:28:54.15 - 00:29:04.30,"Um or we've been starting to move to like surveys where we say, okay, if we have a contact, we'll build a survey for them to input the information into a survey."
b,00:29:04.30 - 00:29:11.75,"And then we that's if everyone fills out the survey, it's a little more straightforward because then we can export survey um data and it's easier to work with."
b,00:29:11.76 - 00:29:23.81,"But yeah, it's still it's still about kind of it's still a fairly manual process like okay, understanding these are the correct contacts at each site to send it out to getting the data, putting it all together, that kind of thing."
b,00:29:23.82 - 00:29:24.48,Yeah.
b,00:29:24.49 - 00:29:35.13,"And do they, let's say somebody has 1000 locations all over the world, they really have access to these factories if they want to do a full."
b,00:29:35.14 - 00:29:36.71,So it depends on the company.
b,00:29:36.71 - 00:29:43.08,"The really mature companies will, will have some kind of, especially if they're pushing 1000 locations that they own."
b,00:29:43.09 - 00:30:01.41,"Um They more mature companies are using, like I said, like I hinted at a bill pay service, Energy does a bill pay service or they'll have a central tracking system where maybe not all of their stores are on it, but some of their stores are on it and so we can take that data and that's it's great when they have it."
b,00:30:01.60 - 00:30:11.62,"Um sometimes they'll have access a lot of the times, especially in the least locations they don't have access to the bills because they don't get billed directly."
b,00:30:11.62 - 00:30:13.62,They're paying the landlord back for utilities.
b,00:30:13.63 - 00:30:29.07,"And those cases we either can ask the landlord for full building data and pro rated by square footage that they that they're occupying the building or if there's no data available, which is often the case with some, we use estimates for for some locations where they don't have data."
b,00:30:29.08 - 00:30:37.38,"Um It's, it's all this is that's the, that's the tedious part really is figuring, okay which locations are we going to get data for?"
b,00:30:37.38 - 00:30:43.66,"Which locations do we need to estimate which locations do we have like maybe full building data, but not just their space."
b,00:30:43.67 - 00:30:48.14,"Um, so that's that's a big tricky challenge that we deal with."
b,00:30:48.15 - 00:30:48.52,Yeah.
b,00:30:48.53 - 00:30:52.52,How do you communicate the accuracy of those estimates?
b,00:30:53.26 - 00:30:53.72,Yeah.
b,00:30:53.73 - 00:31:00.19,"So it's, I think it's like we will use, it depends on how much data we've actually received from the client."
b,00:31:00.20 - 00:31:03.92,"In some cases, we've gotten enough data that we can make."
b,00:31:03.93 - 00:31:11.17,"Um we can come up with estimation factors based on, okay, they have this many sites in a particular region."
b,00:31:11.18 - 00:31:24.86,"We can estimate per square footage based on okay, they're they're typical site usage that's a little more accurate than if we have to go down to use use something like setbacks factors which is, which are more national average."
b,00:31:24.87 - 00:31:28.83,Those are just average factors um based on like the building type.
b,00:31:28.84 - 00:31:55.01,"Um, I think communicating uncertainty is something that corporate greenhouse gas inventories definitely struggle with when, when I was working in my graduate program and on national inventory kind of stuff, uncertainty analysis is a big part of it and will do kind of like monte Carlo simulations to understand because I think people, people misunderstand that these are, these are estimates."
b,00:31:55.02 - 00:31:58.11,"These are not tailpipe measurements of emissions, right?"
b,00:31:58.12 - 00:32:03.82,There's an inherent uncertainty and the emissions factors that are being used in the activity data that's being used.
b,00:32:03.83 - 00:32:08.50,"So, But I think the corporate world isn't ready for that."
b,00:32:08.51 - 00:32:08.84,Right?
b,00:32:08.84 - 00:32:12.25,"I think corporations really, they want one number to report."
b,00:32:12.26 - 00:32:12.51,Right?
b,00:32:12.51 - 00:32:16.60,"They don't want to say, Oh there's a 90% chance our emissions fall within this range."
b,00:32:16.61 - 00:32:21.70,They don't want to say that they want one number and say this is our this is our emissions and this is our target.
b,00:32:21.71 - 00:32:27.12,Um So we don't really we do communicate that okay.
b,00:32:27.12 - 00:32:32.02,The data quality could be improved if we improve data collection efforts at these locations.
b,00:32:32.03 - 00:32:38.32,"But we don't try to include, we don't try to give it a score in terms of data in terms of accuracy."
b,00:32:38.33 - 00:32:42.04,"I don't think, I think a lot of corporations are not ready to hear that."
b,00:32:42.05 - 00:32:45.88,Even even the sites where we did get actual electricity usage information.
b,00:32:46.61 - 00:32:49.66,That's an estimate and there's an uncertainty range around that as well.
b,00:32:49.67 - 00:33:07.57,So um yeah it's we will we will tell companies that okay this is your percentage of locations that provided actuals and um these are the maybe we'll identify oh these are some some of your biggest using sites that we like.
b,00:33:07.58 - 00:33:10.82,Some of your biggest sites that we should focus data collection efforts on.
b,00:33:10.83 - 00:33:16.35,Maybe you don't worry about the one person office right somewhere.
b,00:33:16.35 - 00:33:26.63,Maybe you focus on the larger locations because those are gonna be more material but it's really that's really about that varies company the company depending on how their data quality is.
b,00:33:26.64 - 00:33:27.60,Yeah.
b,00:33:27.61 - 00:33:31.51,Do you ever in your company use a P.I.S.
b,00:33:31.89 - 00:33:34.33,For like utility providers or anything sometimes.
b,00:33:34.34 - 00:33:35.16,Yeah.
b,00:33:35.35 - 00:33:35.79,Yeah.
b,00:33:35.80 - 00:33:41.53,That's that's nice when when they have those but that's often times it takes a lot of time to set up.
b,00:33:41.54 - 00:33:49.93,Um Usually that's most common when they're using an online calculation tool like a que vio for example um has a pretty good connecting.
b,00:33:49.93 - 00:34:00.73,"There's a couple other services um that will allow you provide login details like measurable pride login details to the utility site, connect the meters and then it will automatically import it."
b,00:34:00.74 - 00:34:01.25,And that's great.
b,00:34:01.25 - 00:34:02.88,So yeah we do use that when it's available.
b,00:34:02.89 - 00:34:22.19,Um What other integrations um would be valuable for both customers and yourself like what are some of the common tools like you know if you were an accountant you would say you are an accountant but quickbooks um for like employee data right?
b,00:34:22.20 - 00:34:23.84,Like what is that now?
b,00:34:23.84 - 00:34:42.87,I think looking towards the scope three stuff and thinking about integrations with different one for like for business travel for example things that can occur in a Mex they can do they can provide reports that provide all the necessary data to do these emissions calculations and then thinking about to spend data.
b,00:34:42.87 - 00:34:45.50,Thinking about supply chain things like I know S.A.P.
b,00:34:45.89 - 00:34:49.91,Is working on their own climate solution but even just connecting to S.A.P.
b,00:34:50.74 - 00:35:04.59,Um would probably be helpful and then companies always have their internal systems that they're using to track like Logistics and so whatever whatever kind of logistics platforms they're using I think would be good from a scope three perspective.
b,00:35:04.60 - 00:35:11.96,Um And then internally um yeah whatever accounting software they're using.
b,00:35:11.97 - 00:35:21.12,Um Maybe it's ASAP maybe it's something else usually for when we're talking about scope three like for purchase goods and services were starting to spend data and that's like important to pull out.
b,00:35:21.13 - 00:35:35.19,I think often times that really requires a calm conversation with the accounting department because they don't really understand what we're asking for at first um When we're trying to look at all the spend data and so we have to really explain this is why we're doing it.
b,00:35:35.83 - 00:35:37.11,This is what we need.
b,00:35:37.12 - 00:35:41.36,This is like what level we need it broken down to like we don't need every single transaction.
b,00:35:41.37 - 00:35:46.72,We need kind of like broad categories and and like the names of the customers or suppliers.
b,00:35:46.73 - 00:35:49.29,Um So those kind of things.
b,00:35:51.30 - 00:35:57.35,Would you find that do you think that customers would be more susceptible to?
b,00:35:58.02 - 00:36:05.06,"I don't know, logging into a platform and doing that kind of matching or letting you have all of the data and figuring."
b,00:36:05.06 - 00:36:09.31,Yeah the matching the matching of the spend data is is like more of an art.
b,00:36:09.32 - 00:36:14.49,It's like an art rather than a science to where to match the spend data to what we have emissions factors for.
b,00:36:14.50 - 00:36:19.15,Um Because the client probably doesn't want to do that themselves.
b,00:36:19.15 - 00:36:33.24,"They'll they'll probably turn to us and say okay what spend category like what category this is how much we spent on this item and if there's not a direct match that's like really clear to see, they'll they'll turn to us and be like, how do we quantify this in terms of emissions?"
b,00:36:33.25 - 00:36:45.26,"Um That's a common question that we get which departments are typically like dealing with your overall our main contacts really, it's a range."
b,00:36:45.26 - 00:37:00.73,"So some companies have like a sustainability team who are working with um Other times it's, it's been commonly like pushed onto like the investor relations side of things like say, okay, the investors are asking for the emissions data, you deal with it."
b,00:37:00.73 - 00:37:07.35,And so that's a little more difficult because they don't have any experience with what we're doing and what the calculations really entail.
b,00:37:07.36 - 00:37:50.72,"Um Sometimes also facilities, facilities is a, is a source for data and then accounting as well, accounting is a big source for data, so, but ideally there's at least, and usually it's it's a small sustainability department, the some companies have like really big teams um but a lot of people who are just starting out, it's like one or two people um and that's some another recommendation that oftentimes comes out of the work we do with them is you need more internal resources to devote to this um which is sometimes a hard conversation to have because there's not really uh there's not really a desire to do more, but sometimes there is like sometimes there's a lot of internal support and they're like, yeah, we can hire a sustainability analyst for example."
b,00:37:50.73 - 00:38:00.40,"Yeah, I think that's the path and like jobs in general consultants and then eventually integrated."
b,00:38:00.41 - 00:38:01.35,Yeah.
b,00:38:01.36 - 00:38:34.03,"And then and that's I think some kind of the path that we will put some of our clients on is okay the first year two we're doing the emissions calculations for them, but then our recommendations are really like okay if you if you build an internal system or you get onto an external system, like a like a any kind of carbon accounting platform then you could do that, you can do the calculations yourselves and we can step back and become maybe like a third party verifier or assurance provider, things like that."
b,00:38:35.40 - 00:38:36.08,Okay.
b,00:38:36.09 - 00:38:50.48,"Um yeah, so we are at you know getting closer to the top of the hour, I don't wanna keep you the full time, everyone has to do but is there any other, you know, anything you want to share?"
b,00:38:50.49 - 00:39:42.20,"Um As we work on, we're working on a lot of things that you touched on but it would be helpful to just like get an overview understanding of like the things that you most need and yourself and in like the profession of carbon accounting in general, I think we touched on a lot of the things I think like I mentioned, the boundary setting and the and the data collection are probably the biggest challenge is something related to boundary setting, There is like occasionally like Some like the G2 Protocol is great for most in most cases and there are in some cases where you wish it would be a little more explicit about its instructions because I think it was written in with with the goal of getting as many corporations to participate as possible and actually start accounting for their um carbon emissions."
b,00:39:42.21 - 00:39:56.48,"However, with a different kind of control approaches and some of the different subjective decisions that you can make as a company when you're using the protocol because there's a lot of should rather than Charles and there's a lot of like different ways to do it."
b,00:39:56.49 - 00:40:21.35,"I don't think that a lot of the times the comparability of different um inventories isn't as like exact because some companies will put the natural gas office, the natural gas usage that they're using in their leased offices, some will put it in scope one because it's a fuel combustion, some will put it in scope to because they consider it purchased energy for example and there's, I've seen it done both ways."
b,00:40:21.35 - 00:40:24.02,There's not really clear guidance from the G protocol on it.
b,00:40:24.02 - 00:40:27.38,If you read it one way you can you can make an argument for both sides.
b,00:40:27.39 - 00:40:32.11,So I think the comparability sometimes uh struggles.
b,00:40:32.12 - 00:40:48.84,I know there's efforts like um there's something called the carbon call which I think is an is an effort with like Microsoft and a few other big organizations that are trying to really standardize these carbon accounting principles and make with the goal of making emissions inventories comparable to one another.
b,00:40:48.84 - 00:41:00.33,"So I think that's something that um, would be useful and whether that takes the form of um, I don't know, maybe there's just industry alignment over time or if it's education, I'm not sure."
b,00:41:00.34 - 00:41:04.58,"But yeah, like accessible data visualization."
b,00:41:04.59 - 00:41:07.81,"Yeah, we're like, yeah, just okay, this is how everyone else is doing it."
b,00:41:07.82 - 00:41:18.53,"And, and to some degree, cdP is good for that because you can look at companies cdP responses, but I don't think they're like, I wish that all the methodologies were were open, right?"
b,00:41:18.53 - 00:41:23.84,"And I know that's something that, that you guys are working on two is like having a, having an open methodology, right?"
b,00:41:23.97 - 00:41:27.65,"So that people can look at it and say, okay, this is how they're doing it."
b,00:41:27.66 - 00:41:29.20,We can do it the same way.
b,00:41:29.21 - 00:41:37.80,"Um, we have confidence that everyone that uses this methodology is doing it the same way and we can compare our results and it can be comparable year over year, right?"
b,00:41:37.80 - 00:41:39.36,So that doesn't change over time.
b,00:41:40.54 - 00:41:53.91,"Oh, another another challenge might be that we deal with less frequently is baseline recalculations for, so for when a company maybe they acquire another company and they're like, okay, how does this affect our target?"
b,00:41:53.92 - 00:42:05.17,"And that's usually a fairly like painstaking process of explaining to them, okay, how they can recalculate their baseline so that the target is not completely out of whack because they acquired someone or if they sold someone."
b,00:42:05.29 - 00:42:12.73,"So I don't know if if you guys have any capabilities for baseline recalculations or, or like the same as consolidation method."
b,00:42:13.42 - 00:42:15.61,"So Yeah, kind of."
b,00:42:15.62 - 00:42:36.24,"So it's like if if a hypothetical company sets their baseline in 2019 for example, and then this past year they acquire like a company of similar size, their emissions all of a sudden you're gonna almost double and that looks like they've, if you just use the same baseline year, it looked like their emissions went like shot up."
b,00:42:36.24 - 00:42:40.29,"Even though that's really not like organic emissions growth, those emissions were already occurring."
b,00:42:40.30 - 00:42:42.68,They were just not occurring within the boundary.
b,00:42:43.10 - 00:42:55.81,"So we'll go through a process sometimes of recalculating that baseline saying that, Okay, if you had acquired that, if you did contain those emissions in your boundary in 2019, this is what your baseline would have been."
b,00:42:55.81 - 00:43:05.38,"So in reality you're emissions are like, maybe they're flat, but they didn't like they didn't like double over those last two years when in reality those emissions were already occurring just outside the boundary."
b,00:43:05.69 - 00:43:33.19,"Yeah, I know we're working on that um something similar and I know that it's a heavier math lift than so yeah, that that I would say, yeah, that I'd be interested to see um once you guys have something ready to take a look at for, for that perspective, that's I think it's not super intuitive for clients to understand and the math, because you're at some point you're like back casting for this acquired company, it's a little more complicated."
b,00:43:33.20 - 00:43:35.89,Um So that would be a tool that I would definitely want to take a look at.
b,00:43:35.90 - 00:43:37,"Yeah, awesome."
b,00:43:37 - 00:43:38.28,"Yeah, I'll keep you in mind."
b,00:43:38.29 - 00:43:47,"We definitely want to start now that there are some customers, you know that we have a good amount, we want to start be able to co create with them."
b,00:43:47.01 - 00:43:51.97,"So um yeah, I'll make sure to share some of that work once it's ready."
b,00:43:52.17 - 00:43:53.48,Yeah.
b,00:43:53.49 - 00:43:55.52,"Um Well, thank you very much."
b,00:43:55.53 - 00:44:01.44,"This has been super, super helpful and yeah, we'll be in touch."
b,00:44:01.45 - 00:44:01.74,Great.
