00:00:00.00 - 00:00:19.51,"it was very official, this session is now being reported um Yeah, and we shoot for like 45 minutes, so but we have until one if you want to end early or if you want to keep going to you and there's no wrong answers at all."
00:00:19.51 - 00:00:28.62,"We're just very interested in, you know how you do your work and what kind of workflows you you have and um processes."
00:00:28.63 - 00:00:31.53,"Um so yeah, I'll just introduce myself quickly."
00:00:31.54 - 00:01:07.22,"I am a product designer, I have worked in the city and sustainability space, urban tech and sustainability world for about five years now and um I designed software in that field and really enjoyed speaking to professionals network and you know, those worlds and adjacent um Yeah, I would love to first um here um you know about yourself, any general introduction and especially about your responsibilities and how you came into sustainability as a professional."
00:01:07.23 - 00:01:08.62,Sure.
00:01:08.63 - 00:01:24.91,"Um Well, hi I'm name-extracted, I am the Director of sustainability at comparny-name-extracted um and our team at company-name-extracted were comprised of three people um and we cover both the social impact and environmental responsibility initiatives at the company."
00:01:25.17 - 00:01:37.73,Um We so we have both kind of pieces of sustainability under one team but we all work really cross functionally together to um kind of make sure that we're hitting all of the goals that we've set out for ourselves.
00:01:38.47 - 00:01:57.77,"We actually sit on the supply chain team, so I report directly into the Chief supply chain Officer, which I think is really important to note just because in the apparel and footwear industry um whether you're talking about social impacts and needs or environmental um impacts and kind of risks."
00:01:57.78 - 00:02:27.63,"Uh the majority of those are happening in supply chain um Just kind of the nature of the way that the the industry is kind of set up, so we do everything from social compliance of our audits, you know, auditing for our our upstream suppliers and factories to doing things like setting science based targets, monitoring our restricted substance list and chemical usage, um adhering to our preferred material standards."
00:02:27.63 - 00:02:32.13,We really do quite a lot under this one umbrella of sustainability.
00:02:32.49 - 00:02:53.89,"Um So that's kind of like the behind the scenes work that we do, but we also work really cross functionally with our marketing and creative cohorts across the business to ensure that we're also kind of telling our story in a way that's um validated and transparent and meaningful um and also engaging to our customers."
00:02:53.89 - 00:03:02.10,So we kind of straddle the line of those two sides of doing the work and then helping to tell the story of of what we're doing behind the scenes.
00:03:02.46 - 00:03:05.91,Um I don't know if that's good enough introduction for you.
00:03:05.91 - 00:03:06.49,Okay.
00:03:06.50 - 00:03:09.70,"Yeah, it's really interestingly, yeah."
00:03:09.71 - 00:03:26.76,"Um So I guess we'll start at like the very top and we'll work towards like just very specific like flows but from the highest level, where does the motivation for sustainability um come from?"
00:03:26.76 - 00:03:36.61,"Is it is it really that cause that marketing need or is it something that comes from wanting to a business perspective, or?"
00:03:37.17 - 00:03:45.80,"Yeah, who who is like setting these um initiatives um up as like a core responsibility of the business."
00:03:46.54 - 00:03:48.57,"Yeah, it's probably a bit of both."
00:03:48.57 - 00:04:10.97,"And I would say that we've um we've definitely evolved over the years, but from from the very beginning there's been we our brand just started about 10 years ago, so we're still fairly young and nimble and agile and we're not a huge, you know, organization with very complex, you know, reporting structures and huge teams."
00:04:10.97 - 00:04:12.79,So we're still fairly small.
00:04:12.97 - 00:04:26.19,"And the way that the company was founded was on this idea of transparency first to the customer, we started off by giving full cost breakdowns of all of our garments that we produced on our website and that was really novel at the time."
00:04:26.20 - 00:04:31.79,Um from there we kind of morphed and evolved into transparency of our supply chains.
00:04:31.79 - 00:04:46.21,"So again, we were one of the first companies to um really give insights into the partnerships that we were building upstream of who was actually doing the work of manufacturing, putting together the products that we were creating."
00:04:46.22 - 00:04:56.99,"Um and so that's kind of seamlessly evolved more so into including more of the environmental metrics and also social um metrics as well, which is kind of where we are today."
00:04:56.99 - 00:04:58.63,So it's sort of been part of our D.N.A.
00:04:59.13 - 00:05:18.64,"In one way or another since the very beginning and I think that that core so we've sort of had like a mission driven organization from um from kind of the inception of the brand, it's just kind of taken different different stages depending on on the time of our iteration."
00:05:18.97 - 00:05:26.59,Um So we do have a mission today that is very core to how we work and operate.
00:05:27.15 - 00:05:35.48,"Um And it's it's also our sustainability mission as well, so um I think that's kind of driving at the core."
00:05:35.48 - 00:05:50.05,And then we also have from a very kind of top level perspective all of our c suite in some way shape or form now have sustainability metrics kind of built into their performance uh performance.
00:05:50.06 - 00:05:51.83,Um Kpi s.
00:05:51.84 - 00:05:57.89,Um And so those kind of trickle down into into each of the individual teams that we're working with.
00:05:57.89 - 00:06:05.56,So it's sort of the piece that I think differentiates us and sets us apart but we're also really powerful storytellers.
00:06:05.57 - 00:06:09.76,So um I wouldn't minimize the marketing angle either.
00:06:09.77 - 00:06:15.51,Um I think we really see that as as this is kind of our differentiating feature and we want to talk about it.
00:06:15.52 - 00:06:23.28,Um We also want to create a movement with our customers and with our communities where we're selling and where we're operating so um.
00:06:23.94 - 00:06:24.89,Yeah.
00:06:24.90 - 00:06:25.90,Yeah it's awesome.
00:06:25.91 - 00:06:32.73,Um Yeah I remember whenever linda started um and I was like well this seems like a less expensive.
00:06:32.74 - 00:06:39.30,"Still sure so I'm gonna go there and I've been to the store in Soho, it's a really great experience all through."
00:06:39.31 - 00:06:40.75,Yeah.
00:06:40.76 - 00:06:55.93,"Um So um there's definitely a lot of interesting parts that you've mentioned, but we've heard that there's a lot of from our experience um there's a lot of issues with supply chain um data gathering and management."
00:06:55.94 - 00:06:59.19,Um Would you like what is that process?
00:06:59.19 - 00:07:01.40,"Like, like how do you find your suppliers?"
00:07:01.40 - 00:07:03.13,How do you survey them?
00:07:03.14 - 00:07:05.23,Um how do you audit them?
00:07:05.23 - 00:07:09.92,"And like what is, what are the biggest challenges with your suppliers?"
00:07:11.05 - 00:07:11.95,Oh gosh.
00:07:11.96 - 00:07:15.96,Uh that's a that's a lot of question.
00:07:15.97 - 00:07:23.94,"Um Sorry, I also have Covid right now, so if I might need to mute occasionally just to talk it out."
00:07:23.95 - 00:07:29.26,Um So uh a few different things.
00:07:29.26 - 00:07:44.16,"So we many of our factories, we've actually, I don't know the exact percentage today, it's got to be like 65 70% of the factories that we've worked with, we've actually had relationships with for five years or more."
00:07:44.17 - 00:08:24.43,"So the majority of our upstream suppliers are people that have been in our network for quite a while, but because of a lot of the recent supply chain challenges and changes primarily due to Covid but also for other uh kind of socio political um issues, we have been kind of exploring additional partnerships, so the way that we find um factories and facilities is probably very similar to the way others do just by by researching, we also get a fair amount of um of factories and suppliers reaching out to us because they want to work with us."
00:08:24.44 - 00:08:55.17,"Um So it kind of depends, we do have a pretty rigorous um uh what we call like a risk assessment where we collect a lot of documentation up front around the kind of performance of the factory, not just on the quality and technical side which we have people in our quality and sourcing and product development teams who are asking about like equipment and machinery and like what kind of no house and you know cost breakdowns and things like that."
00:08:55.17 - 00:08:57.89,So there's like a business side of our risk assessment.
00:08:58.23 - 00:09:09.31,Um And then more importantly for the sustainability side we do a risk assessment based on um like history of social audit performance.
00:09:09.31 - 00:09:16.11,So we ask for historical records um that the the facilities can share with us.
00:09:16.11 - 00:09:23.95,We're also looking at um whether or not they have certain certifications that also align with the work that we're doing.
00:09:23.96 - 00:09:27.11,Either on a material side or on a process side.
00:09:27.11 - 00:09:29.41,So it can be a G.O.T.S
00:09:29.86 - 00:09:35.77,Certification for being for producing uh uh organic cotton goods.
00:09:35.78 - 00:09:43.22,It can be a GRS certification for being able to produce um certified recycled good materials or products.
00:09:43.23 - 00:09:45.38,Um But it can also be like a Z.H.C.
00:09:45.85 - 00:09:51.49,Certification which is for um water and chemical practices.
00:09:51.49 - 00:09:57.69,So we're kind of looking on on a few different fronts and it sort of depends on what the specialty of that factory is.
00:09:58.04 - 00:10:10.18,"But we do, we have like a matrix that we we plug different, um, different performance values into that kind of gives us whether or not this this factory could kind of fit our needs or be a good partner."
00:10:10.19 - 00:10:21.05,"Um, I think a big part of what we, what we try to stress is communication and um, we we like to have meetings prior to covid, we would have done a lot of this in person."
00:10:21.32 - 00:10:23.86,"Um, but right now we're doing a lot of it over zoom."
00:10:23.86 - 00:10:37.12,"So we go through a pretty rigorous, uh, kind of upfront vetting process and then before we ever, um, you know, place any orders or start any production in a factory."
00:10:37.12 - 00:10:40.94,"We do our own, um, third party audit assessment."
00:10:40.94 - 00:10:46.50,"So we work with a company called Elevate, um, and also another company called arch advisors."
00:10:46.51 - 00:10:58.67,"And those are two third party social compliance, um, environmental compliance, uh, companies that, that have a lot of boots on the ground, a lot of, um, throughout the world."
00:10:58.67 - 00:11:03.65,"So there, you know, they cover a lot of different geographical regions."
00:11:03.65 - 00:11:05.53,They speak a lot of the local languages.
00:11:05.53 - 00:11:11.92,They have an understanding of some of the nuances of things like migrant labor and various countries or regions.
00:11:11.92 - 00:11:17.18,"And so they we do, we don't do any of this in house because we just don't have the knowledge or expertise."
00:11:17.18 - 00:11:24.15,"And we're also um, really contained by what we're able to where we're able to go right now."
00:11:24.37 - 00:11:36.60,So we leverage these third parties who go out on our behalf and complete a full audit of each facility far before we ever um would place an order in any factory.
00:11:36.61 - 00:11:48.60,"So we do that process and then we continue to do that year after year, just as kind of a um uh on this path kind of we we say towards continuous improvement."
00:11:48.61 - 00:12:11.79,"Um so we're tracking kind of progress and outcomes of these audits over time um with the hope that eventually um you know, maybe we won't have to do them anymore, but that's kind of a very far um not something that that that the industry is uh is really ready for, but that's kind of the idea is that all of these places will be operating well."
00:12:12.33 - 00:12:17.03,Um And then on the environmental side we use a couple of different tools.
00:12:17.04 - 00:12:33.12,"I think first of all, we we try to align ourselves with factories that already inherently have some type of environmental um metric kind of or or they're doing something kind of above and beyond to begin with."
00:12:33.12 - 00:12:50.57,So we work with a lot of factories that um are kind of on the cutting edge of various technologies that help with water savings and recovery or chemical management or um just kind of specialize depending on what their expertise is.
00:12:50.57 - 00:12:52.05,So you mentioned silk.
00:12:52.05 - 00:13:04.21,"So we work with this great factory um in china that uh is leed certified and they have solar solar panels, you know, direct solar on their roofs."
00:13:04.21 - 00:13:09.62,And they have this amazing kind of blue sign certified chemical and water recovery process.
00:13:09.62 - 00:13:20.49,So we try to find like these special um factories and makers throughout the world to our specialists and what they do but are also doing what they do better than the rest.
00:13:20.50 - 00:13:28.14,Um so that's kind of another point that that we really try to search for in building out those long term relationships.
00:13:29.11 - 00:13:34.93,But we are also um uh using using a tool called the Hig F.E.M.
00:13:35.56 - 00:13:38.96,This is a a tool that the S.A.C.
00:13:39.40 - 00:13:45.79,"Or the sustainable apparel coalition has been building for the past, I don't know a decade and a half or something."
00:13:46.11 - 00:13:59.88,Um and so the facilities tool specifically is an annual uh kind of survey that has been audited or verified by a third party and and they are collecting information across a number of different indicators.
00:13:59.88 - 00:14:13.61,"So we're looking at um air emissions, looking at electricity use, um water use and consumption, water effluent waste generation uh details on materials."
00:14:13.62 - 00:14:32.26,"So there's a whole host, it's a very extensive um kind of survey and that's really the best way aside from our our audits that were performing um that's the best way that we're really getting kind of detailed factual information on an environmental perspective from each of our factories."
00:14:32.27 - 00:14:47.08,"So we're in the process of rolling this out, I think um about 90% of our Tier one factories are now on boarded and something like 80% of our strategic tier two um are on this platform as well."
00:14:47.08 - 00:14:51.90,"So it's a really good way for us to kind of look at the dashboard, so to speak."
00:14:51.90 - 00:15:02.16,"It's not really built in a dashboard format that we can download, download the individual results and kind of put them in a big spreadsheet and um see trends and track them over time."
00:15:02.17 - 00:15:09.12,So that's sort of what we're doing and are the factories in putting all this information themselves is a very manual for them.
00:15:09.12 - 00:15:14.95,"Like how do you, how do you, how do you know it's accurate or is that the auditing process?"
00:15:14.96 - 00:15:17.16,So that's the verification part of it.
00:15:17.16 - 00:15:30.18,So um there and and the majority of the facilities that we're working with right now do have their scores verified there in the inputs verified at this point.
00:15:30.40 - 00:15:49.86,"Um, and we have kind of like a, a work up to this point as well, so maybe like the first year of partnership, we just have them do a self assessment and then we build it in that the second year, you know, depending how things are going, we work with them for the year, we'll have them go through the verification process etcetera, etcetera."
00:15:49.87 - 00:15:56.10,So I think the first time is probably the most cumbersome and difficult.
00:15:56.11 - 00:16:19.83,"But what's good about this platform is um the year over year kind of scores or details would be uh you can kind of like carry them over, so it's, you don't have to go through necessarily like all of the same work and calculations, but you know, like what kind of details and documents you need to gather to kind of complete it."
00:16:19.83 - 00:16:28.52,"So I think like with all of these reporting mechanisms, there is a level of probably difficulty and and time consumption that goes into it."
00:16:28.53 - 00:16:58.73,"Um but what's also good about Hig is it's at least to my knowledge, the only kind of unified um survey that a lot of these factories are receiving and it's becoming a bit um it's not quite ubiquitous, but I think it's, it's kind of on its way to that path where a lot of brands in particular are, are kind of requiring this of of at least tier one factories."
00:16:58.74 - 00:17:08.32,"Um so I think, you know, a factory just has to do it once and if another brand has already asked them to do it, they can just share those results with us or vice versa."
00:17:08.32 - 00:17:11.45,"If we've asked them to do it, they can send it to somebody else who's asking for it."
00:17:11.46 - 00:17:26.87,"So it's kind of a unified system where we're collecting the exact same information across the industry and across factories for really easy kind of benchmarks and comparisons and um hot spot analysis, it's really interesting."
00:17:26.88 - 00:17:34.60,"Um Yeah, the fashion industry definitely has, like a lot of sustainability tools that I'm sure are very specific to."
00:17:34.61 - 00:17:36.06,Yeah.
00:17:36.07 - 00:17:58.70,"Um so in your team, um it sounds like you've had um well from what I saw in your linkedin, you've had an education and sustainability, but is that is that common, or is there any type of education that you have to do once you receive these materials, like how do you translate them and make them useful for the rest of the organization, or?"
00:17:58.71 - 00:18:04.39,"Yeah, maybe not useful, but yeah, what is that, you know, share out process to your stakeholders?"
00:18:04.40 - 00:18:06.46,"Yeah, that's a really good question."
00:18:06.46 - 00:18:14.40,That's something that um we we take a lot of care to pay a lot of attention to.
00:18:14.41 - 00:19:16.66,"Um and I think that's why I mentioned the piece about how closely we work with our marketing team in the beginning is um I think we both, because of our size, we're also what we're also a privately held company and sustainability kind of broadly has sort of been part of our our messaging and our our yeah, our reason why um for for a very long time, so it's really important that we get the story right, And um but that also it's the same is true for our internal storytelling as well, um because we really need kind of everybody to be on board and to be aligned with these bigger missions, you know, the bigger mission and these goals that we've set out for ourselves because they really are quite tough and it's not something that the rest of the industry kind of largely is doing, so it takes a lot of work, um but I think it's also a reason why a lot of employees join company-name-extracted in to begin with."
00:19:17.37 - 00:19:46.77,"So um I do have one person on my team who is actually an environmental analyst and she also has an educational background in sustainability, um but specifically in agriculture and uh but she her previous work was all in communication, so she kind of also has this really interesting um uh kind of, I don't know, she's got a lot of skills both on the analytical side, but also on the calm side."
00:19:46.78 - 00:20:28.64,"So we do a lot of work just kind of internally educating um not just keeping everyone up to date, but actually going to specific teams and kind of helping them understand um what what our goals are and how they specifically influence or impact what those goals mean, So um we've done things like sort of internal road shows where we've gone around to all of the strategic kind of teams that we've identified as being part or impactful to a specific goal and we kind of help break it down for them, help them understand what we're looking for like this year versus five years away and like where we should sort of be long term."
00:20:29.15 - 00:20:46.42,"Um and we also do things like we hold office hours, we present in every I present in every monthly um uh company, all hands that we have on updates, where we just try to like, hit people on multiple kind of levels and layers to get them engaged and excited."
00:20:46.43 - 00:21:00.29,"Um and we found that that's really worked, at least for us, I mean, we still get tons of questions, people just, there's a lot of interest, people really want to know what we're up to, what we're doing and uh that we're actually doing what we say we're gonna do."
00:21:01.02 - 00:21:13.73,"So I sometimes feel more pressure from our internal teams than I do from like, press or anyone else that like, asks us questions about what we're doing, because it really is a hard, it's a high bar to live up to."
00:21:13.74 - 00:21:28.45,"Um but I think at the end of the day, like, what we're really trying to do is make make our goals and and our work around sustainability, just part of the regular kind of almost equivalent to business acumen."
00:21:28.45 - 00:21:37.37,"So, as the finance team in all hands is presenting on our financials as like, you know, all of these like, traditional business units are presenting."
00:21:37.37 - 00:21:46.86,We also have sustainability presenting right alongside them to show how how how or how not our goals are kind of lining up with each other.
00:21:46.86 - 00:22:04.13,"So I think it's really important from like that top down perspective, but that we're also getting in, you know, throughout various levels and across various teams like helping to really break down the science or the metrics um into a way that's really understandable for everybody."
00:22:04.14 - 00:22:08.28,Um and hopefully that also translates out to our customers as well.
00:22:08.81 - 00:22:42.25,"Yeah, I mean that sounds like a pretty utopian sustainability company based on like a lot of our people that we talked to, they're like we need to be better aligned with business goals and Yeah and you guys even have leadership KPI s tied to sustainability and that's something very specific heard before and like what how are those KPI s um like tracked and checked um like you have to go and say okay you met um your goals for this year."
00:22:42.26 - 00:22:51.28,Um do does the leadership understand how to achieve those goals or like what is what are the actions that are set in place?
00:22:51.29 - 00:22:54,"Yeah, that's a good question."
00:22:54 - 00:23:07.50,"And I'll also say that a lot of this kind of um more substantial side of like the goal setting, the strategic roadmap we've built, this is all just happened in the past year and a half."
00:23:07.51 - 00:23:09.33,So it's still a little new.
00:23:09.33 - 00:23:16.26,"So like all of these um these kind of specifics are really new to, to our organization."
00:23:16.27 - 00:23:31.73,Um It was the topics are not new but like the strategy and the tracking is um so the way that we're doing it is we're trying to actually build into all of our existing systems.
00:23:31.74 - 00:24:14.05,"so we already use a system right now where every individual in the company, no matter what your department or level, um you have to go in and set goals for yourselves, that kind of ladder up to our overarching company um company goals that we have like 3 to 5 strategic goals for the company, those then get distilled on the team basis, and then you have your individual goals that you're working towards, so we do that on a quarterly basis, and then we also have to write feedback for ourselves and have conversations with our direct managers about our goals and our progress and kind of what we want to work on in the future."
00:24:14.06 - 00:24:34.45,"So um this is something that our people team or our HR team is really in control of, but um depending on the team and and kind of like what our sustainability priorities are, specific teams will have those like sustainability goals that are built into that goal setting process."
00:24:34.46 - 00:25:04.60,"So um we have them for, we have really big preferred material schools, so this is something that our raw material sustainability product development and sourcing teams have written into their kind of goals for for this year, we only do it on like an annual basis, I kind of wish maybe we could do it a little further out, um but it's just it's just annual, so each quarter you kind of are like setting your little mini goals for that bigger annual goal."
00:25:04.81 - 00:25:14.56,"Um but we do the same thing for our carbon reduction goals, um we do the same thing for some of our social uh social impact measures."
00:25:14.57 - 00:25:20.33,Um and those are the really big ones.
00:25:20.34 - 00:25:22.91,"Oh, but then we also have like marketing goals as well."
00:25:22.92 - 00:25:34.81,"Um So depending on like the function and the and what the goals are, like, there will be specific kind of indicators that are being tracked that way."
00:25:34.82 - 00:25:40.68,I don't think it's a super um savvy.
00:25:41.52 - 00:26:04.82,"Um but that's just kind of like the best tool that we have right now, so I'm sure we're we're actually not um really tracking that closely, like how were we don't have like the agility or like the real time, uh like accuracy to see how how a team or how an individual is, is tracking at any given time."
00:26:06.22 - 00:26:11.45,But I think what we do see is the change in some of the numbers.
00:26:11.46 - 00:26:20.57,"So like we are tracking on it on a more macro level, like how we are transitioning from conventional cotton to organic based on like fabric count."
00:26:20.58 - 00:26:33.84,"Um Similarly for for carbon emissions, like we do similar exercises, we know um kind of what, depending on which factories we allocate to or which materials were building into."
00:26:33.84 - 00:26:40.89,We can kind of get a sense of directionally where our emissions profile is going to be for next year for instance.
00:26:40.90 - 00:26:49.05,"So I've seen like material things and yeah, that was like a lot of information."
00:26:49.57 - 00:26:51.19,Yeah.
00:26:51.20 - 00:27:02.40,When you say this tool that you used to track um I think your KPI is is that like just a KPI tracking tool or is this something that you know something that your HR team built into?
00:27:02.40 - 00:27:04.74,No it's it's called reflective with a.
00:27:04.74 - 00:27:05.69,K.
00:27:05.70 - 00:27:11.55,Um And it's I think it's something a lot of like startups kind of use.
00:27:11.55 - 00:27:18.20,It's just um I'm sure I'm sure we pay for access to it but it's basically just like a pr tracker.
00:27:18.21 - 00:27:26.40,Um And I think it's a way to help facilitate like conversations and goal setting between leaders and team members.
00:27:27.17 - 00:27:29.40,Um Cool.
00:27:29.40 - 00:27:35.49,So moving on to um Science based target work.
00:27:35.49 - 00:27:44.86,"Have you, has your organization put any resources towards um specifically the science based target initiative?"
00:27:45.39 - 00:27:47.24,What has that been like?
00:27:47.82 - 00:27:54.77,So we um were approved for our science-based target in October of 2021.
00:27:55.33 - 00:28:09.81,"Um And pride in the lead up to that, we had actually hired a consulting firm to perform our 2019 baseline kind of greenhouse gas footprint."
00:28:09.82 - 00:28:20.92,Um And in the process of kind of going setting up for two to propose are science based targets.
00:28:20.93 - 00:28:28.72,We started working with a second group called watershed which is more of like a platform to help measure.
00:28:29.25 - 00:28:34.16,So we've we've definitely put resources into like the measurement side.
00:28:34.17 - 00:28:59.84,"Um we're now working with with watershed on a kind of an ongoing basis um to perform our annual footprints, trying to really get a lot um closer and uh more, more real time as much as possible within that measurement and also build out tools to be able to project what um, what our emissions profile is going to be based on the decisions that we're making."
00:28:59.84 - 00:29:10.61,So one of the maybe interesting things about the apparel and footwear world is The decisions that we're making.
00:29:10.61 - 00:29:15.92,So we work basically a calendar year um ahead of time.
00:29:15.93 - 00:29:31.52,"So the product that we are designing and developing right now in August of 2022 is going to be the product that we're actually going to realize emissions for in August of 2023 um, and possibly even later."
00:29:31.76 - 00:29:52.52,"So we're trying to build with watershed a tool or a way to kind of get a sense of instead of looking backwards, doing like an annual review of the previous year's greenhouse gas footprint, how can we actually make better decisions today?"
00:29:52.53 - 00:29:56.06,Based on what we know our goals are set to be in the future.
00:29:56.07 - 00:29:58.47,So we know that we want to be at a certain place.
00:29:58.65 - 00:30:05.02,"Um, you know, by the end of 2025, just kind of directionally to show progress towards our 2030 goal."
00:30:05.03 - 00:30:16.48,"So like what do we need to do today, what do we need to be thinking about from a materials perspective from a manufacturing perspective, obviously logistics etc, like all of the decisions."
00:30:16.49 - 00:30:29.03,"Um, so that we can kind of get more of like more into the projecting um side of things rather than just like a retrospective analysis of our previous results."
00:30:29.04 - 00:30:49.08,So we're putting a lot of uh kind of human resources into that right now into thinking about how that would how that could just sort of manifest and be used as a tool and and also cross functionally as a as a tool for like a directional read on our climate goals.
00:30:49.09 - 00:30:57.19,Um But yeah we've we've done quite a bit of work especially for a company of our size in in in the C.T.
00:30:57.99 - 00:31:01.59,And what has the relationship with watershed been like?
00:31:01.59 - 00:31:12.71,Are they more on a consultant type of um feeling I guess um rather like or is it does it feel like they're part of your company?
00:31:12.72 - 00:31:24.01,"Um It doesn't feel like they're part of our company, it definitely is more like a consulting relationship but they've been really great and helpful."
00:31:24.01 - 00:31:33.50,So we were we were the for their first um kind of fashion company that signed onto their platforms.
00:31:33.50 - 00:31:54.30,"So the first year that we worked together with a lot, I mean we had weekly calls like um we really were helping them I think build what their dashboard and kind of back end system needed to look like and be and kind of compute for for our industry."
00:31:54.78 - 00:32:00.24,Um So that was a look that that's been you know a year in the making.
00:32:00.25 - 00:32:29.80,"Um and now we still, we now have bi weekly calls with them and we work very closely just to kind of continue both on the measurement side, but also on this this build out of this kind of special part of the tool that we really want to see um embedded in the platform, so um yeah, I guess it is more like a consultant consulting relationship and is there So you you've been you've submitted and it has been accepted your science-based target."
00:32:29.81 - 00:32:35.60,"And how do you, what's the process internally of uh reporting on how you're doing?"
00:32:35.61 - 00:32:46.09,"Um is it I believe it's like 20, and it's an organic cotton, I believe you said um like what is the process of reporting on that?"
00:32:46.75 - 00:33:03.41,"So for science based targets, um I think the requirement is that you just have to be publicly reporting what your your progress or your challenges whatever um on an annual basis in the format and venue of your choice."
00:33:03.42 - 00:33:08.67,So it's really open open ended from a company perspective as far as reporting goes.
00:33:08.68 - 00:33:11.76,Um This is also something new Forever Lane.
00:33:11.76 - 00:33:16.63,We we just published our first sustainability report in april of this year.
00:33:17.79 - 00:33:32.70,Um so this is going to be the kind of forum that we're going to continue to update our constituents um about our our greenhouse gas accounting um in our sustainability report.
00:33:32.70 - 00:33:44.53,So we we've now kind of aligned that all of our major initiatives were just going to ladder into this report um and we'll be publishing it on an annual basis.
00:33:44.54 - 00:34:03.11,"Um But then we also use our just like website as well, so we have kind of an offshoot landing page that's connected to our sustainability site um where we just talk about our science based targets and we try to break it down for anybody who wants to learn more."
00:34:03.88 - 00:34:07.96,Um So yeah that's that's kind of where we're reporting it right now.
00:34:07.97 - 00:34:25.50,"We're not we are not yet um disclosing to carbon disclosure project or um any other uh Yeah, I don't know reporting structures um Yeah, we're just trying to take like 11 step at a time."
00:34:25.51 - 00:34:54.67,"Yeah, it sounds great um Yeah, so we're getting closer to the top of the hour, is there in general in Korea whether ever lean or past um jobs, like what are some of the biggest challenges that you've seen faced in either measurement or like the management or reporting of um a sustainability um Just very loaded question but um anything that you want to share would be great."
00:34:54.67 - 00:35:01.05,I mean like what are just the biggest challenges you've seen or anything?
00:35:01.05 - 00:35:01.63,Yeah.
00:35:01.64 - 00:35:35.87,"Yeah, I think the biggest challenge, Well there are a lot of challenges I think um the first is that our systems don't always talk to one another, so we actually have quite a number of like pretty big work drivers that were working against um right now that would just be so seamlessly easy if our internal systems could kind of speak to these like external platforms um or at least push information into them."
00:35:35.88 - 00:35:44.86,Um I think that's a really big myths and that's just something that's kind of like a recurring theme.
00:35:44.86 - 00:35:57.80,"Those are also the projects that tend to take the most kind of upfront thought and preparation and and it's really something you have to build into, it's not something you can just like plug in and and have it seamlessly operate."
00:35:57.81 - 00:36:03.66,So um I would say at a Berlin we're a little behind on that front.
00:36:03.67 - 00:36:14.80,Um just having our our systems kind of be equipped to talk to others um And and vice versa have them have been talked to our systems as well.
00:36:15.40 - 00:36:35.06,"I think in in the kind of carbon accounting world there's always this push and pull between um you know using your using primary data and uh leveraging averages, regional country, you know, whatever specific averages."
00:36:35.07 - 00:36:54.98,"Um And this is a really hot topic in our industry right now, I'm not sure if you've been following some of the news but um there's the Hig platform has actually gotten some pretty big um backlash and write ups um for various various reasons, I think like generally L."
00:36:54.98 - 00:36:55.20,C.
00:36:55.20 - 00:36:59.38,"A methodology, databases that are either open or closed."
00:36:59.39 - 00:37:10.28,"Just an ongoing discussion of like how accurate are these values, especially from external forces kind of trying to poke in and poke holes."
00:37:10.29 - 00:37:16.67,"Um you know, I think in an ideal world we would all love to be using primary data."
00:37:16.68 - 00:37:21.55,"The uh the reality is like we just can't, it's not feasible."
00:37:21.55 - 00:37:29.56,"So we have to leverage some, you know, pro proxies where we, where we need to um and just have that as a directional read."
00:37:29.56 - 00:37:37.59,"So I'm not sure if there's as much pressure and maybe some other industries around this, but certainly in the, in the fashion world there is."
00:37:38.32 - 00:38:12.69,"Um, so there's, there's that concern and yeah, I still think, I think that there's just like a real um I don't know if it's a misunderstanding or a disconnect or what, but I think there's still just not a very strong understanding kind of broadly um of how, how the decisions we make, what the, what the product kind of makeup is, um, how that impacts what like an emissions profile can be."
00:38:12.69 - 00:38:31.63,"And I think emissions are actually one of the easier ones to understand whenever we start talking about water and chemistry it or like soil health, biodiversity, like all of these really big um topics that are so crucial and important are actually really difficult to kind of break down into sizable chunks."
00:38:31.90 - 00:38:36.48,Um and I think that's difficult for a customer perspective for sure.
00:38:36.49 - 00:38:56.31,"Um you know, whenever they're just looking to buy a new t shirt or a pair of jeans that fit um it's kind of hard to kind of make the jump to this like educational world where you're talking about like carbon footprint and, you know, soil microbiome health, like it's, it's just very complex and complicated."
00:38:56.49 - 00:39:09.09,"Um and it's even hard from an internal perspective to even at a company like ever lane where the population is super interested and they, they're hungry for information and they want to learn."
00:39:09.09 - 00:39:18.01,I think there's still a lot of just misunderstanding about what it means and what the right decisions are and how we kind of can get there.
00:39:18.02 - 00:39:32.64,"So, um, yeah, I don't know, I hope it, I hope it all becomes more part of the vernacular and just kind of a way of doing business, but we're definitely trying to build something, I think that doesn't exist most places."
00:39:32.64 - 00:39:35.30,And so that's really difficult.
00:39:36.06 - 00:39:36.58,Yeah.
00:39:36.59 - 00:39:44.81,"Yeah, but also there's a lot of action in that world at the moment and the carbon accounting software platforms."
00:39:44.82 - 00:39:51.76,"Yeah, it's watershed and a lot of other companies each have very specific ways of handling it."
00:39:51.77 - 00:39:53.96,Um so it's improving.
00:39:53.97 - 00:39:58.76,"Uh but yeah, is there anything this has been super helpful?"
00:39:58.77 - 00:40:09.24,"Um, your experience is very, very, um extends and it's been a great conversation for myself and I'm sure my colleague was taking notes as well."
00:40:09.25 - 00:40:22.17,"Is there anything else that you would want to share about, you know, any other challenges or anything and sustainability and like just the profession and where it's going and Yeah, sure."
00:40:22.17 - 00:40:31.93,"Yeah, I mean, I think um at least in the apparel industry, it seems to be a growth, it seems to be growing and kind of not stopping."
00:40:31.93 - 00:40:56.69,"I remember whenever I first um I started working in this industry, there were few and far between, I mean obviously like the big examples that everybody thinks about Patagonia Island fisher obviously have existed for a long time, but the amount of jobs just from like job searches that I saw back then compared to now is like mind blowing."
00:40:56.70 - 00:41:07.89,"Um so I definitely think that it seems like this is a growing kind of trend um which I think can only yield really positive results, I think."
00:41:07.90 - 00:41:48.61,"Um and I'm curious to know what you all are seeing as well in your research, but there's still, it still seems like we're all kind of occupying very small teams and team structures within organizations, even huge parent companies tend to have like much smaller uh sustainability teams compared to others, um although there is still quite a lot of, you know, metrics and analysis and strategizing, like there's still quite a lot of complexity in the work that we do, but we just sort of have to be jacks of all trades for a long time until the size of our teams can grow."
00:41:48.62 - 00:42:29.91,"Um So I don't know, it's, I think maybe the next horizon or at least what I'm hoping is, you know, not everybody can kind of be the sustainability person or people in a company, but um hopefully there's you know, more education or at least more of a path to education for these types of topics within like specific trades or studies, so um I don't know, so they're a little sustainability advocates who are, you know, joining out of college to work in product development and they have a background and understanding similarly to what you would for like general accounting or or like finance."
00:42:29.92 - 00:43:25.48,"Um So I don't know, I haven't really seen that, I've seen a lot of big explosion in um people who are like traditionally educated or trained on these subjects who are coming in to kind of set the strategic goals um for companies generally, but not as much um you know, sustainability being like part of an education across other uh Yeah, that's actually a theme that I keep hearing and it's not all of our research at all, like we're we work on like right now we're working on auditing platform, we're looking to incorporate um ways to manage your science based targets, but everyone that I've spoken to has said something along the lines of like how it needs to become more part of the business and so it was really interesting to hear that your leadership has kpi s attached to sustainability."
00:43:25.67 - 00:43:45.19,"Um But I think yeah that's kind of what every company is gonna, you know, eventually it will, it's kind of like a thing now and eventually it will disappear and it will become something that we all do and attached to all of our KPI s and all of our professionals, no matter what role you have."
00:43:46.26 - 00:43:49.39,"Yeah, well that's certainly what we're trying to do."
00:43:49.39 - 00:44:00,"But um again, ever Lynn is kind of a special place and we're we're also not like governed by um you know, we're not publicly traded."
00:44:00 - 00:44:06.09,"So I don't think we have a lot of the same pressure um to deliver on, you know, whatever."
00:44:06.10 - 00:44:12.27,"Um But yeah, I don't know, it's it's interesting, it's an interesting time."
00:44:12.27 - 00:44:14.61,"I think we're seeing a lot of progress, which is really cool."
00:44:14.62 - 00:44:15.73,Yeah.
00:44:15.74 - 00:44:21.50,"Yeah, I'll let you get back to your day and I hope you feel better."
00:44:21.50 - 00:44:26.34,"This has been super helpful, thank you so much for your time and Yeah, no worries."
00:44:26.35 - 00:44:27.74,Happy to talk with you.
00:44:27.75 - 00:44:32.67,Are you all going to be publishing something or is this more just for internal research?
00:44:32.68 - 00:44:34.34,The research is internal.
00:44:34.35 - 00:44:38.10,"Um Yeah, we were not publishing anything."
00:44:38.11 - 00:44:42.40,"Our platform is at, our website has sustained that life."
00:44:42.41 - 00:44:46.05,Um We we have some screenshots.
00:44:46.06 - 00:44:55.71,"Um I believe, yeah, you can, if you are interested in getting more information, you could schedule a demo or I could connect you to that person myself."
00:44:55.72 - 00:45:00.44,"Um you know, I don't want to do any type of sales."
00:45:00.45 - 00:46:01.77,"No, no, it it might be interesting at some point maybe I don't know where in like your iteration um you're at, but I think we're always really intrigued to just kind of like learn what's out there and understand um you know what various platforms or partnerships would both cost us, but also afford us in in these big goals that we have, and I think a common theme is just like trying to um remove complexities for everybody um and so if we can use tools or platforms or software or whatever to kind of help us do that, then that's obviously really great, but okay, um so if I introduce you to someone via email, that's okay and Yeah, okay, cool, I'll find out who to connect you with and yeah, we have a lot of different things that you touched on, so they'll be able to help you out."
00:46:01.78 - 00:46:02.41,Cool.
00:46:02.42 - 00:46:04.92,"Yeah, well, thank you so much."
00:46:05.72 - 00:46:06.50,Alright.
00:46:06.83 - 00:46:07.54,You too.
00:46:07.55 - 00:46:08.30,Bye.
