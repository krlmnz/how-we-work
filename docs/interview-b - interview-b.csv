timecode,transcript
00:00:00.00 - 00:00:01.42,sounds very official.
00:00:01.43 - 00:00:05.02,This session is now being recorded Alright.
00:00:05.03 - 00:00:08.19,"Very official, very official."
00:00:08.20 - 00:00:25.86,Um Okay so we are working on some research with consultants as well as um in house sustainability professionals to improve our products and um I'm a senior product designer here.
00:00:25.87 - 00:00:36.86,I basically have been talking to a lot of different people and well you know it helps us gain information to make our products better so there's no right or wrong answers.
00:00:36.87 - 00:00:45.22,"Um it's you know, your experience, that's a valuable thing here and usually we we take about 45 minutes."
00:00:45.23 - 00:00:53.17,"Um I booked for an hour but it doesn't have to be 45 you know, it's whenever we have like a good conversation around then."
00:00:53.18 - 00:01:19.59,"Um Well I'm gonna ask you questions about just high level general like how you got started and then we can talk about more specific tasks you have issues with that you would love like software solutions for but yeah, before you know I keep going um it would be great to hear about your experience and and how you got into carbon accounting and sustainability."
00:01:20.16 - 00:01:20.97,Sure.
00:01:20.98 - 00:01:22.48,So my name is name-extracted.
00:01:22.48 - 00:01:24.81,I'm a senior associate here at company-name-extracted.
00:01:24.82 - 00:01:26.79,We are a full service E.S.G. Uh consultancy firm.
00:01:29.96 - 00:01:41.28,"So we do everything from the more qualitative report writing gap analysis, materiality assessments all the way to the more technical side of things which involves mainly carbon accounting which is what I do."
00:01:41.29 - 00:01:52.34,Um I joined company-name-extracted after previously being at a firm that specialized in um third party assurance and verification.
00:01:52.35 - 00:02:01.84,"So primarily over carbon greenhouse gas emissions data, but we also touched on like water and waste and DNA metrics as well."
00:02:01.85 - 00:02:11.76,Um but that really allowed me to get a a lot of exposure to a lot of different industries and how they all tackled their various unique issues when it came to carbon accounting.
00:02:11.77 - 00:02:12.78,Prior to that.
00:02:12.79 - 00:02:21.99,"Um My Master's degree, my Master's degree was actually from Colorado state in greenhouse gas, so very specific to the, to the work that I'm doing now."
00:02:21.99 - 00:02:24.20,"So I'm pretty, I'm pretty lucky that this job exists."
00:02:24.21 - 00:02:51.92,"Um and then prior to that, prior to that I my undergraduate degree in environmental science and so really if you want to start the first thing I, the first time I ever really uh um got any experience with carbon accounting at all was doing research on permafrost carbon in Alaska and how that is affecting the carbon cycle and how permafrost thaw is exposing more carbon to be to be um to be released."
00:02:51.93 - 00:02:54.57,So kind of that was a backwards looking way.
00:02:54.57 - 00:02:57,"But yeah, started from an environmental science perspective."
00:02:57.01 - 00:02:58.93,Um kind of moved into it.
00:02:58.94 - 00:03:11.11,"Um looking at inventories on all different levels, even from national government level inventories in some my graduate work and then moving towards the corporate side of things."
00:03:11.12 - 00:03:12.37,Um after I graduated.
00:03:12.38 - 00:03:22.79,"So yeah that's my background um we do inventories for companies that are either, they're really early on in the process taking their first steps."
00:03:22.79 - 00:03:28.61,"They maybe they don't have a program at all yet, or companies that have been doing this for a few years and they just want to make things better."
00:03:28.61 - 00:03:31.70,"They're ready to expand to scope three, they're ready to set targets."
00:03:31.71 - 00:03:39.08,Um That kind of thing is that um does that tend to be very tailored for the customer?
00:03:39.08 - 00:03:41.54,Like how does how does the project begin?
00:03:41.55 - 00:03:44.84,"Yeah, so it really does depend on the customer's needs."
00:03:44.85 - 00:03:57.14,"Um like I said, if, if we just take an example of some customer, a customer who has never done any greenhouse gas accounting before and they've never done that, this is the first year inventory."
00:03:57.15 - 00:04:01.81,Um it really starts by understanding their business and understanding which sources we need to look at.
00:04:01.81 - 00:04:12.55,"So that boundary setting step is um, is one of the trickier parts of the process, but definitely one of the more important understanding, okay, which locations do we need to look at?"
00:04:12.55 - 00:04:14.51,What sources do we need to be looking for?
00:04:14.51 - 00:04:20.58,"Some some clients are very straightforward in which they, okay, we only have leased office space in buildings."
00:04:20.58 - 00:04:23.23,"We that's it, that's our, that's our physical footprint."
00:04:23.23 - 00:04:24.99,We don't even have a vehicle fleet.
00:04:25 - 00:04:34.30,"Um, so those are a lot more straightforward than maybe a hypothetical manufacturing client where they have manufacturing facilities, they burn a lot of fuel."
00:04:34.31 - 00:04:42.08,"Maybe they have a vehicle fleet, maybe they have um, some potential fugitive emissions um from their processes."
00:04:42.09 - 00:04:49.02,"Um and then, so really it starts with understanding each client what their, what their specific needs are."
00:04:49.03 - 00:05:16.21,"Um and then, and then we move into kind of the data collection phase, which as I'm sure you're aware is oftentimes the most challenging, especially especially for clients who have never done this before, collecting data is oftentimes, especially the first time around, usually always a pretty big headache because so I mean some clients have the more established clients of, okay, we have processes in place when we pay our bills, we track our electricity usage as well."
00:05:16.22 - 00:05:20.94,"Maybe they use a bill pay service, like energy or someone like that, That makes things a lot easier."
00:05:20.95 - 00:05:24.37,"But unfortunately those are few and far between most of the time, it's okay?"
00:05:24.38 - 00:05:32.11,"We need to go to our actual locations, go back in time for the years that we're looking to do this inventory for actually collect the data?"
00:05:32.12 - 00:05:37.50,Um That a lot of times and that requires like working with company context to understand.
00:05:37.50 - 00:05:41.20,"Okay, who, who has access to this data, where does it sit?"
00:05:41.21 - 00:05:45.35,Um That's often times the most time consuming part of the process.
00:05:45.36 - 00:05:46.77,Yeah.
00:05:46.78 - 00:05:57.14,"And do you find that the data is consistent throughout, like, let's talk about manufacturing and like support chain and all of that."
00:05:57.15 - 00:06:02.52,"Um Like what I've heard before, is that data comes in all different formats."
00:06:02.53 - 00:06:09.50,"Is that something that you experience, Do you guys have any sort of process around that cleaning it up and making it consistent?"
00:06:09.51 - 00:06:13.11,"Yeah, it definitely comes in all different formats depending on the location."
00:06:13.12 - 00:06:25.99,"If we're just talking about scope one and scope to data usually that's fairly simple enough to to bring together, although it's a little tedious because it normally comes in just okay, this is our electricity bill is their natural gas bill."
00:06:25.99 - 00:06:32.58,"We just have to kind of pull the units off that unless they have a centralized system which like I said, it's few and far between."
00:06:32.59 - 00:06:43.97,"If they do have a centralized system we can run an export and say, okay, what's the usage for all of these sites over the time period we're looking at but then thinking about supply changes in scope three, that's when it gets a lot more inconsistent."
00:06:43.98 - 00:06:57.98,Different companies have different ways of tracking or different levels of tracking um The data that we need a lot of the times for scope three assessments were really starting with kind of that spend based data as part of the initial screening to determine.
00:06:57.98 - 00:06:58.17,Okay.
00:06:58.17 - 00:07:03.56,Which which categories are most relevant material to that company?
00:07:03.57 - 00:07:17.87,"Um And then when we want to move on to more more advanced calculations for things like purchase goods and services, things like downstream transportation, distribution, that's where the data is kind of all over the place depending on the client."
00:07:17.87 - 00:07:18.27,"Right, okay."
00:07:18.27 - 00:07:39.85,"One client may track, we've shipped, we know we've shipped this money units to this location and it went by rail or for example like that but it's really inconsistent I think and I think part of the problem is that only only the companies that are like the furthest along have really established systems to track that kind of information."
00:07:39.86 - 00:07:49.08,Um These I mean and that's talking about a hypothetical client that makes like a physical product for scope three other clients.
00:07:49.08 - 00:07:51.65,When you're thinking about scope three their biggest sources.
00:07:51.65 - 00:08:02.05,"Or maybe it's maybe it's business travel, maybe it's just produce goods and services, employee commuting and business travel is one of the ones that a lot of clients like to start with just because the data is the most available for it."
00:08:02.06 - 00:08:08.03,"And they can, I think they can conceptually understand where the emissions come from when it comes to business travel."
00:08:08.03 - 00:08:10.49,"Like they understand, okay, flying on a plane produces emissions."
00:08:10.78 - 00:08:17.61,Um some of the other categories are a little more nebulous and they require a little more explanation for them to get it to get why we're collecting it.
00:08:17.62 - 00:08:28.99,"Um But yeah, it's definitely that's definitely an issue is okay all the different formats the data comes in and and it's really a fairly manual process to try to get it in the right format that we need."
00:08:29 - 00:08:31.62,Um in order to do the calculations on it.
00:08:31.63 - 00:08:32.58,Yeah.
00:08:32.59 - 00:08:45.74,"And you also mentioned, you mentioned like the business travel is easy for customers to understand what's a not easy want to understand and like what kind of do you have to share resources with them is it?"
00:08:45.74 - 00:08:47.22,Like an education?
00:08:47.23 - 00:08:58.40,"Yeah, sometimes like I think they call clients here scope three and they're like okay, we know we have to do scope three but a lot of times they don't know what the different scope three categories are."
00:08:58.41 - 00:09:02.16,They also don't know where the boundaries begin and end for scope three.
00:09:02.17 - 00:09:09.06,"Um I think you have sold products is definitely something that people struggle with, especially if they don't make like a physical product, right?"
00:09:09.06 - 00:09:17.10,"If if they make a physical products a lot easier to understand, which is really what the protocol is designed to like, that's what is written around."
00:09:17.11 - 00:09:25.75,"It's like a hypothetical product that uses energy um some of those indirect emissions that are optional and then clients are like okay, do we have to account for?"
00:09:27.10 - 00:09:38.63,"Um I'm trying to think of a good example of a category they don't really understand, they don't understand um the fuel and energy related activities category because I need to, that's usually more of an education process."
00:09:38.63 - 00:09:48.90,"Understanding okay, what transmission and distribution losses are why there are emissions upstream for when the fuel to produce electricity is extracted, that kind of thing."
00:09:48.91 - 00:09:53.95,Um purchase goods and services often sometimes takes a little bit of explanation.
00:09:53.96 - 00:10:00.98,"Okay, the things that you buy have embodied emissions because they took emissions they took energy to produce."
00:10:00.99 - 00:10:06.86,"Um So yeah, there's definitely an education component when it comes to each scope three category."
00:10:06.87 - 00:10:11.64,And I think the big question is like okay which of these do we have to account for?
00:10:11.65 - 00:10:12.99,And then like what's the limit?
00:10:13 - 00:10:14.81,What's the boundary on these categories?
00:10:14.81 - 00:10:17.28,How far down the chain do we need to go?
00:10:17.29 - 00:10:22.74,Um A lot of like I said it's easier with clients that make a physical product.
00:10:22.75 - 00:10:25.04,I think that's it's a lot more straightforward clients.
00:10:25.05 - 00:10:39.40,"Yeah with clients that are like um like financial services clients, they're really struggling with the especially because the methodology for category 15 investments category is there's still so many different methodologies out there for calculating that."
00:10:39.41 - 00:10:42.73,Um They're like okay what do we need to include?
00:10:42.73 - 00:10:54.88,And I think there's some some things that are lost in translation when comparing the language of how financial services discuss their different different types of investments versus how the G.
00:10:54.88 - 00:10:56.13,Protocol discusses it.
00:10:56.14 - 00:10:58.08,Um So that's a little bit of a trance.
00:10:58.09 - 00:11:06.39,Like that's a that's a hard exercise into into their terminology right into language they understand.
00:11:06.40 - 00:11:08.48,Um Yeah it's hard.
00:11:08.69 - 00:11:12.41,Yeah I've heard that a lot like everyone has their own version of that.
00:11:12.41 - 00:11:15.26,It's like talking to marketing or talking to these people.
00:11:15.27 - 00:11:27.52,"It's like a lot of Yeah especially because there's so many different data sources across the company, like so many different departments in a company need to be involved in a complete like if you're doing like a complete scope, three inventory?"
00:11:27.53 - 00:11:28.85,You understand?
00:11:28.85 - 00:11:33.65,Okay accounting is involved for the spend data but then facilities involved.
00:11:33.66 - 00:11:38.45,"Okay do we have any like leased assets or where do we send our, where are all our products going?"
00:11:38.46 - 00:11:53.83,They take so many different sides of the company to do a full inventory That um getting everyone to talk in the same language is sometimes difficult but that's also part of like okay learning the company itself and understanding what what they do.
00:11:54.93 - 00:11:55.88,Yeah.
00:11:55.89 - 00:12:01.03,Um And you also mentioned that you do party auditing.
00:12:01.04 - 00:12:04.92,Is that yeah we do verification and assurance over over some clients.
00:12:04.92 - 00:12:14.27,That was my we do we do some um prior with a firm called Apex um Who did exclusively we didn't do any consulting.
00:12:14.27 - 00:12:16.52,We exclusively did verification and assurance.
00:12:16.53 - 00:12:30.64,"Um So that's a that's a different kind of engagement where that's more we're following a pretty strict protocol in order to check their emissions calculations, check that background data."
00:12:30.65 - 00:12:37.69,Um That's really something that we see clients that are more that are further along in the process go for.
00:12:37.69 - 00:12:40.10,Maybe they've been doing their inventory for a few years.
00:12:40.11 - 00:12:45.73,They feel pretty good about their methodology so then they were like okay we want third party assurance of it.
00:12:45.73 - 00:12:52.03,And so it's we're checking sampling of the source data that they're using their calculation methods.
00:12:52.03 - 00:12:53.70,The actual calculation numbers themselves.
00:12:53.70 - 00:12:55.19,The roll ups that kind of thing.
00:12:55.20 - 00:13:14.59,"Um Yeah is that a fairly manual process like you know you want to check specific calculation and then you like go into your own software or like Yeah, so it depends on the software that the client is using for their um For their inventory somewhere."
00:13:14.59 - 00:13:15.16,Just a lot.
00:13:15.16 - 00:13:17.06,Most are just doing it in Excel still.
00:13:17.07 - 00:13:19.32,Um and so that is really just okay.
00:13:19.32 - 00:13:20.66,We will check.
00:13:20.67 - 00:13:25.01,I'll take they so they'll they'll have acclaimed emissions total.
00:13:25.02 - 00:13:26.47,So I'll take like a subset.
00:13:26.47 - 00:13:32.16,"Okay, they say for this office, this is the total amount of emissions, this is the total amount of electricity usage."
00:13:32.16 - 00:13:40.46,"I'll do my own calculations to say, Okay, does that match up we have a materiality threshold, like plus or -5% of the whole scope that we work on?"
00:13:40.90 - 00:13:43.25,Um The that's fairly manual.
00:13:43.25 - 00:13:46.32,"I mean, it depends if they're using like online carbon accounting platform."
00:13:46.32 - 00:13:53.73,"Sometimes it can actually be a little more difficult to check those calculations because in Excel they're very visible, right?"
00:13:53.73 - 00:13:56,"You can click on a cell, see where things are coming from."
00:13:56.01 - 00:13:59.88,Um but they're a little more opaque on an online carbon couching platform.
00:13:59.89 - 00:14:15.16,"Um but then the other part of what we do is we review a selection of like documentation for background data that was like, okay, you claim you used 100,000 kilowatt hours here."
00:14:16.03 - 00:14:17.26,Where can you prove that?
00:14:17.26 - 00:14:18.57,Can we see the invoices for that?
00:14:18.57 - 00:14:22.13,"Or can we see a report from, your utility provider saying this is how much energy used."
00:14:22.14 - 00:14:41.63,"and so in that case is when they're using an online platform, it's usually a little easier because they have the opportunity to attach evidence to particular like items so we can go in so we have to request less from the actual client and sometimes if we're trying to get those electricity bills, it's back and forth with a particular office or with the utility provider that takes some time."
00:14:41.64 - 00:14:50.74,"But if they've uploaded that evidence to a system, it's, it's a little more straightforward for us to go and say, okay, we can see for january at this location, this is the electricity usage."
00:14:50.75 - 00:14:51.60,Right.
00:14:52.57 - 00:14:53.05,Yeah.
00:14:53.06 - 00:15:02.43,"And what are some of the common challenges in auditing um when you go back and forth, what what are those back and forth?"
00:15:03.43 - 00:15:34.54,"Um I think like I said a lot of it is okay, this is the data like this is the data we need um that's what takes a lot of the time is okay actually getting some of the source data, I think a lot of companies don't have a, I really flushed out inventory management plan for example, where they describe the exact methodology of their calculations and the exact methodology of how they collect their data in the few instances where I've worked with clients that do have that."
00:15:34.55 - 00:15:40.20,"It really helps the auditing process because we can understand, okay, this is where that data is coming from."
00:15:40.21 - 00:15:47.08,"This is how, if there's any QA QC procedures, this is what they are um and then this is how the calculation is done."
00:15:47.08 - 00:15:53.54,These are the emission factors we use having something like a document like that that's laid out is really helpful um but it's not very common.
00:15:53.55 - 00:15:55.55,"Okay, that's what we're working on."
00:15:55.56 - 00:15:57.26,Yeah.
00:15:57.27 - 00:15:58.42,"Yeah, no that's definitely great."
00:15:58.42 - 00:16:24.42,"Like understanding like this is the methodology, this is this is the process and procedures is like something that at the beginning of an audit is always super helpful to read through it because it just that would reduce the number of questions that I have for the client right the back and forth a lot of the times like looking at it from a third party perspective, you'll have questions that are really not, it's really not an issue, not a verification issue."
00:16:24.43 - 00:16:26.60,It's really just something that needs to be explained.
00:16:26.61 - 00:16:35.45,Um and so it's a quick back and forth but having having that that methodology like laid out in front of you can reduce the number of back and forth.
00:16:35.45 - 00:16:36.87,You need to have great.
00:16:36.88 - 00:16:47.23,"Um So aside from auditing you also you know, back to the client work and the measurement and all of that."
00:16:47.24 - 00:17:00.70,Um is there any interest in having some sort of like science based targets package or I don't know like is there any specific things that you do for that initiative?
00:17:01.21 - 00:17:05.67,Yeah for science based targets that's usually that we go through that process quite a bit.
00:17:05.68 - 00:17:12.19,"It's a pretty common ask once once companies have been doing their inventory for a few years, they're looking to set targets."
00:17:12.20 - 00:17:22.81,Um And it's becoming less common for companies just but I think a few years ago companies would just pick up either pick an arbitrary number or pick something that they thought they could achieve and set that target.
00:17:23.09 - 00:17:28.33,Now there's a lot more interest in science space targets having that approved.
00:17:28.34 - 00:17:49.09,So when we go through that process um often times it's kind of in combination with a with a scope three screening because they want to know if okay if their scope three emissions are greater than 40% they have to set a scope three science based targets and sometimes the people interested haven't haven't completed their full scope three inventory yet.
00:17:49.10 - 00:17:55.21,"Um So that's the first part is like okay, scope three screening determine if they need to set a scope three target."
00:17:55.22 - 00:18:00.57,Usually in almost all cases it's yes because scope three emissions are so much bigger than scope one and two.
00:18:00.58 - 00:18:18.75,Um but then it's really about they clients want to either either they'll commit immediately and then they'll say okay we have two years to figure it out or they really want to understand their target options before they even commit publicly to setting them.
00:18:18.76 - 00:18:24.71,So what we'll do is take their emissions inventory and model out most commonly used.
00:18:24.71 - 00:18:25.30,We'll use the S.B.T.I.
00:18:25.65 - 00:18:27.71,Tools to model out.
00:18:27.71 - 00:18:30.03,Okay these are your potential targets right?
00:18:30.03 - 00:18:33.80,If you set a absolute emissions target it looks like this.
00:18:33.80 - 00:18:38.98,If you set the intensity target it looks like this back when to under two degrees C.
00:18:38.98 - 00:18:40.15,And 1.5 degrees C.
00:18:40.15 - 00:18:40.88,Targets were allowed.
00:18:40.88 - 00:18:43.72,We would model at both those different pathways and show them the difference.
00:18:43.73 - 00:18:46.10,Now it has to be below 1.5 degrees C.
00:18:46.10 - 00:18:50.99,So we'll model out both of those different pathways and then a lot of clients won't understand.
00:18:50.99 - 00:18:55.27,"Okay so this is a hypothetical target, is it achievable for us?"
00:18:55.28 - 00:19:08.55,So well okay if you um if you purchased all this renewable energy where would that put you on in relation to your goal if you covered all your electricity with renewables for example.
00:19:08.56 - 00:19:19.83,Um So then it's more okay then they will publicly commit and then we'll go through the more formal target setting process which is a little more rigorous in terms of science based targets will come back and ask questions about.
00:19:19.83 - 00:19:22.84,Okay how did you do your inventory?
00:19:22.84 - 00:19:25.36,Did you account for this particular thing and scope three?
00:19:25.37 - 00:19:28.09,So that's more of a back and forth with the science based targets group.
00:19:28.10 - 00:19:32.12,Um But yeah so that's kind of an overview of the process there?
00:19:32.13 - 00:19:38.52,Um And it is with the science based targets tools are are great to a degree.
00:19:38.53 - 00:19:50.07,Sometimes it's a little confusing that their their version numbers are they like they'll have multiple versions up that exist on the internet and if you're using like an outdated version you gotta be careful because it won't it won't give you the same math.
00:19:50.08 - 00:20:03.04,Um but we'll we'll check it internally with our with our with our own calculations because usually those Percentage reductions are pretty straightforward and we can just say Oh it's 4.2% each year or something like that.
00:20:03.05 - 00:20:12.57,Occasionally clients will want to be more aggressive than the actual what the tool spits out as they're like minimum pathway for 1.5 degrees C.
00:20:12.58 - 00:20:15.80,Um So well we'll adjust that as well.
00:20:15.81 - 00:20:17.09,Yeah.
00:20:17.10 - 00:20:26.46,Um And what is like what is that conversation with um the client and them getting buy in from their organization or do you not?
00:20:26.47 - 00:20:28.82,Are you not as involved in that part?
00:20:28.83 - 00:20:33.89,Usually usually they come to us when they already have buying to set a target.
00:20:33.90 - 00:20:37.34,However sometimes it's something that comes up.
00:20:37.35 - 00:20:41.49,Say we're doing an initial scope three or scope one and two inventory.
00:20:41.49 - 00:20:44.61,Maybe some scope three part of our recommendations.
00:20:44.62 - 00:20:52.11,"We always provide recommendations at the end of the project things to think about, oh this is this is where you could potentially look to look reduce your emissions."
00:20:52.12 - 00:20:57.83,You should consider setting a target and usually our suggestion is to point them towards the science based targets as best practice.
00:20:57.84 - 00:21:11.77,Um Occasionally they've they've looked at that and they say this makes sense for us but really um yeah if they trust our advice coming out of the initial inventory and we say we think science based targets are best practice.
00:21:11.78 - 00:21:14.11,Occasionally they'll say yes let's do it.
00:21:14.12 - 00:21:30.45,Sometimes it needs to come from higher up um to get by and maybe they're getting pressure um from investors or things like that to set rates or um or from or we're seeing slightly more and more supply chain connections right?
00:21:30.45 - 00:21:37.24,"For for maybe some of their customers, their biggest customers, their biggest suppliers want their value chain to have targets set."
00:21:37.25 - 00:21:40.16,So that occasionally will be a motivator as well.
00:21:40.81 - 00:21:41.72,Yeah.
00:21:41.73 - 00:21:48.21,And are the are the tools that you have to use per client?
00:21:48.22 - 00:21:51.58,Um You know like do they change at all?
00:21:51.59 - 00:21:55.09,Um What is the biggest challenge with science based targets?
00:21:55.10 - 00:22:00.36,Because often what I hear is that it's the same challenges as everything else?
00:22:00.36 - 00:22:01.50,Like it's the data really.
00:22:01.50 - 00:22:08.14,But is there any specific um Any specific tools that you use for this process?
00:22:08.15 - 00:22:09.16,Yeah.
00:22:09.17 - 00:22:18.59,"I think there's not really, not really any tools, I think the process is slightly different just depending on the client, depending what what scope three categories are material to them."
00:22:18.59 - 00:22:32.42,"Scope one and 2 is usually pretty straight forward, no matter what it's like the sci fi target tool is gonna spit out A potential target that that meets their criteria that's below 1.5°C pathway."
00:22:32.43 - 00:22:44.10,"Thinking about the script targets Are a little more if you're not looking into the net zero guidance, which some clients are looking at like long-term net zero targets for like 2050 or earlier."
00:22:44.11 - 00:22:51.83,Those have to they expand that boundary that you have to cover 90% of your scope three emissions or 95%.
00:22:51.84 - 00:22:53.25,I can't remember off the top of my head.
00:22:53.94 - 00:23:07.41,"Um but the scope three targets for Like the near-term targets or the medium-term targets that are like 10 years out, they don't have to cover that much of your scope three emissions."
00:23:07.41 - 00:23:16.19,So some some companies and you can see this on the science-based target website will set a sense we target only over a certain category of their scope three.
00:23:16.20 - 00:23:24.67,So that's really where it gets more customized depending on the client is the scope three target and the potential for that um scope one and two is usually more straightforward.
00:23:24.67 - 00:23:31.42,"But yeah, I think If they have a scope on into inventory and it's completed that target setting process is fairly straightforward."
00:23:31.43 - 00:23:38.75,"It is when it gets comes to scope three, it's really determining some some clients are like, Okay, are we above or below that 40% threshold."
00:23:38.75 - 00:23:43.75,That means we have to set a scope to target and then once they say they're above it.
00:23:43.75 - 00:23:43.97,Okay.
00:23:43.97 - 00:23:46.07,Which which combination of categories?
00:23:46.71 - 00:23:50.41,I think it's about 60% of the scripture emissions have to be included in the target.
00:23:50.42 - 00:23:53.45,So which combination of categories do we need to set a target on?
00:23:53.46 - 00:23:58.75,Can we set a target just on 11 category.
00:23:58.75 - 00:24:03.51,For example if they have one category that really dominates their um their scope three emissions.
00:24:03.51 - 00:24:09.74,So that's where it gets a little more a little more difficult and a little more customized depending on the client.
00:24:09.74 - 00:24:11.34,And there's not really a tool that we use.
00:24:11.34 - 00:24:13.79,It's kind of just math um to determine.
00:24:13.79 - 00:24:14.08,Okay.
00:24:14.10 - 00:24:18.19,"Does they, do they are they meeting the threshold if they include these categories?"
00:24:18.19 - 00:24:24.97,"Are they meeting the threshold if they're only setting a target on, you know, just 13 category?"
00:24:24.98 - 00:24:25.98,Yeah.
00:24:25.99 - 00:24:46.08,And within your own company and colleagues um is it do you guys often have the same client or is it an autonomous thing where like I'm working on this client or is it more of like usually it's a team um there'll be a team of associates and a couple analysts on each client engagement.
00:24:46.09 - 00:24:58.18,"Um But these are you the science based target process is usually part of a bigger scope of work that we have for a client, usually there's other things happening in parallel at the same time but that maybe other members of my company are working on."
00:24:58.19 - 00:25:06.18,"Um Yeah, so it's it's really not like one person going off and setting a target for someone is really a team thing."
00:25:06.19 - 00:25:07.21,Yeah.
00:25:07.22 - 00:25:08.91,How do you guys collaborate?
00:25:08.91 - 00:25:40.74,"Like and how Yeah, I mean I think it's it's mostly about I mean it's just about communicating with each other and like I said okay you can use the science based targets tool tool to model out their potential scope one and two targets and you can use it to model their potential school three and then we kind of we usually bring them together in some form of presentation slides to show them okay these are your target options and will work collaboratively collaboratively in those slides usually power point."
00:25:40.75 - 00:25:56.59,"Um I don't think there's any good I mean Excel obviously we're using to do something, do the calculations um and then we'll maybe we'll write up a report and say okay these are your missions these your target options, that kind of thing."
00:25:57.15 - 00:25:57.74,Yeah.
00:25:58.35 - 00:25:58.99,Cool.
00:25:59 - 00:26:11.62,So overall in like your work and your company um what are some of the bigger challenges that you face that you know that we could be helpful in with like software tools?
00:26:11.62 - 00:26:21.03,So we have larger men were working on a lot of things and we're trying to work more specifically with um creating tools for consultants.
00:26:21.04 - 00:26:31.07,Um So what what do you see out there in the world challenges like not specific features that you need but just like I think the biggest challenge.
00:26:31.07 - 00:26:42.90,And this is something we talked we just we touched on briefly is that data collection side of things for the client to to really if if a client doesn't have a centralized system where they're tracking all of these different information that we need?
00:26:42.90 - 00:26:50.36,"It's hard to build that uh for each, each individual client because every client system systems are kind of different."
00:26:50.37 - 00:26:56.45,Um I know there's progress made on this with the ability to connect to some systems with a P.I.S
00:26:56.87 - 00:26:58.79,Or other other things like that.
00:26:58.80 - 00:27:13.68,"I think just it's almost more like okay in educating educating the clients that, so this is to make them understand that this is information that needs to be tracked year over year or even like month to month and have that all in one central location."
00:27:13.69 - 00:27:29.07,"I think that's the biggest challenge that we deal with is really they sometimes they'll they'll do, they'll do an inventory, they'll get us all the data for one year and then they'll they'll maybe forget about it for a whole another year until they're ready to do it again."
00:27:29.08 - 00:27:31.71,And that's really not the most efficient way to collect this data.
00:27:31.71 - 00:27:33.55,It really should be an ongoing process.
00:27:33.56 - 00:27:36.32,Um That's the biggest challenge.
00:27:36.32 - 00:27:41.14,I think another one is potentially the boundary setting.
00:27:41.15 - 00:27:49.37,"Um discussions, clients really don't understand the difference between the different control approaches that the GsC protocol uses."
00:27:49.37 - 00:27:53.20,So like operational control financial control equity share approach.
00:27:53.21 - 00:27:59.98,They're also really concerned about the sec has proposed climate rule and what that means for setting their boundaries.
00:27:59.99 - 00:28:13.61,"I think in the climate rule it might have, we'll see when it finally comes when the final version comes out, but are they going to need to align their greenhouse gas emission boundaries with their financial reporting boundaries like they have in their in their 10-K.S."
00:28:13.91 - 00:28:16.29,Um So that's that's another one.
00:28:16.29 - 00:28:17.87,So data collection and the boundary setting.
00:28:17.88 - 00:28:20.10,Our two big ones I think.
00:28:20.59 - 00:28:26.64,Do you provide any sort of templates or any spreadsheets that they can get started on?
00:28:26.64 - 00:28:27.21,Like when?
00:28:27.22 - 00:28:36.36,"Yeah, we usually we'll send them a data collection spreadsheet after we if we if we know okay there's this many locations and they all use, we won't understand."
00:28:36.36 - 00:28:37.89,"Okay, do they use electricity?"
00:28:37.89 - 00:28:47.31,Do they use natural gas will send kind of a either a Excel template or that they can fill out and then return to us.
00:28:47.97 - 00:28:54.14,"Which is great when they do a lot of times they don't do that, they just send back the bills and they make us pull out the information."
00:28:54.15 - 00:29:04.30,"Um or we've been starting to move to like surveys where we say, okay, if we have a contact, we'll build a survey for them to input the information into a survey."
00:29:04.30 - 00:29:11.75,"And then we that's if everyone fills out the survey, it's a little more straightforward because then we can export survey um data and it's easier to work with."
00:29:11.76 - 00:29:23.81,"But yeah, it's still it's still about kind of it's still a fairly manual process like okay, understanding these are the correct contacts at each site to send it out to getting the data, putting it all together, that kind of thing."
00:29:23.82 - 00:29:24.48,Yeah.
00:29:24.49 - 00:29:35.13,"And do they, let's say somebody has 1000 locations all over the world, they really have access to these factories if they want to do a full."
00:29:35.14 - 00:29:36.71,So it depends on the company.
00:29:36.71 - 00:29:43.08,"The really mature companies will, will have some kind of, especially if they're pushing 1000 locations that they own."
00:29:43.09 - 00:30:01.41,"Um They more mature companies are using, like I said, like I hinted at a bill pay service, Energy does a bill pay service or they'll have a central tracking system where maybe not all of their stores are on it, but some of their stores are on it and so we can take that data and that's it's great when they have it."
00:30:01.60 - 00:30:11.62,"Um sometimes they'll have access a lot of the times, especially in the least locations they don't have access to the bills because they don't get billed directly."
00:30:11.62 - 00:30:13.62,They're paying the landlord back for utilities.
00:30:13.63 - 00:30:29.07,"And those cases we either can ask the landlord for full building data and pro rated by square footage that they that they're occupying the building or if there's no data available, which is often the case with some, we use estimates for for some locations where they don't have data."
00:30:29.08 - 00:30:37.38,"Um It's, it's all this is that's the, that's the tedious part really is figuring, okay which locations are we going to get data for?"
00:30:37.38 - 00:30:43.66,"Which locations do we need to estimate which locations do we have like maybe full building data, but not just their space."
00:30:43.67 - 00:30:48.14,"Um, so that's that's a big tricky challenge that we deal with."
00:30:48.15 - 00:30:48.52,Yeah.
00:30:48.53 - 00:30:52.52,How do you communicate the accuracy of those estimates?
00:30:53.26 - 00:30:53.72,Yeah.
00:30:53.73 - 00:31:00.19,"So it's, I think it's like we will use, it depends on how much data we've actually received from the client."
00:31:00.20 - 00:31:03.92,"In some cases, we've gotten enough data that we can make."
00:31:03.93 - 00:31:11.17,"Um we can come up with estimation factors based on, okay, they have this many sites in a particular region."
00:31:11.18 - 00:31:24.86,"We can estimate per square footage based on okay, they're they're typical site usage that's a little more accurate than if we have to go down to use use something like setbacks factors which is, which are more national average."
00:31:24.87 - 00:31:28.83,Those are just average factors um based on like the building type.
00:31:28.84 - 00:31:55.01,"Um, I think communicating uncertainty is something that corporate greenhouse gas inventories definitely struggle with when, when I was working in my graduate program and on national inventory kind of stuff, uncertainty analysis is a big part of it and will do kind of like monte Carlo simulations to understand because I think people, people misunderstand that these are, these are estimates."
00:31:55.02 - 00:31:58.11,"These are not tailpipe measurements of emissions, right?"
00:31:58.12 - 00:32:03.82,There's an inherent uncertainty and the emissions factors that are being used in the activity data that's being used.
00:32:03.83 - 00:32:08.50,"So, But I think the corporate world isn't ready for that."
00:32:08.51 - 00:32:08.84,Right?
00:32:08.84 - 00:32:12.25,"I think corporations really, they want one number to report."
00:32:12.26 - 00:32:12.51,Right?
00:32:12.51 - 00:32:16.60,"They don't want to say, Oh there's a 90% chance our emissions fall within this range."
00:32:16.61 - 00:32:21.70,They don't want to say that they want one number and say this is our this is our emissions and this is our target.
00:32:21.71 - 00:32:27.12,Um So we don't really we do communicate that okay.
00:32:27.12 - 00:32:32.02,The data quality could be improved if we improve data collection efforts at these locations.
00:32:32.03 - 00:32:38.32,"But we don't try to include, we don't try to give it a score in terms of data in terms of accuracy."
00:32:38.33 - 00:32:42.04,"I don't think, I think a lot of corporations are not ready to hear that."
00:32:42.05 - 00:32:45.88,Even even the sites where we did get actual electricity usage information.
00:32:46.61 - 00:32:49.66,That's an estimate and there's an uncertainty range around that as well.
00:32:49.67 - 00:33:07.57,So um yeah it's we will we will tell companies that okay this is your percentage of locations that provided actuals and um these are the maybe we'll identify oh these are some some of your biggest using sites that we like.
00:33:07.58 - 00:33:10.82,Some of your biggest sites that we should focus data collection efforts on.
00:33:10.83 - 00:33:16.35,Maybe you don't worry about the one person office right somewhere.
00:33:16.35 - 00:33:26.63,Maybe you focus on the larger locations because those are gonna be more material but it's really that's really about that varies company the company depending on how their data quality is.
00:33:26.64 - 00:33:27.60,Yeah.
00:33:27.61 - 00:33:31.51,Do you ever in your company use a P.I.S.
00:33:31.89 - 00:33:34.33,For like utility providers or anything sometimes.
00:33:34.34 - 00:33:35.16,Yeah.
00:33:35.35 - 00:33:35.79,Yeah.
00:33:35.80 - 00:33:41.53,That's that's nice when when they have those but that's often times it takes a lot of time to set up.
00:33:41.54 - 00:33:49.93,Um Usually that's most common when they're using an online calculation tool like a que vio for example um has a pretty good connecting.
00:33:49.93 - 00:34:00.73,"There's a couple other services um that will allow you provide login details like measurable pride login details to the utility site, connect the meters and then it will automatically import it."
00:34:00.74 - 00:34:01.25,And that's great.
00:34:01.25 - 00:34:02.88,So yeah we do use that when it's available.
00:34:02.89 - 00:34:22.19,Um What other integrations um would be valuable for both customers and yourself like what are some of the common tools like you know if you were an accountant you would say you are an accountant but quickbooks um for like employee data right?
00:34:22.20 - 00:34:23.84,Like what is that now?
00:34:23.84 - 00:34:42.87,I think looking towards the scope three stuff and thinking about integrations with different one for like for business travel for example things that can occur in a Mex they can do they can provide reports that provide all the necessary data to do these emissions calculations and then thinking about to spend data.
00:34:42.87 - 00:34:45.50,Thinking about supply chain things like I know S.A.P.
00:34:45.89 - 00:34:49.91,Is working on their own climate solution but even just connecting to S.A.P.
00:34:50.74 - 00:35:04.59,Um would probably be helpful and then companies always have their internal systems that they're using to track like Logistics and so whatever whatever kind of logistics platforms they're using I think would be good from a scope three perspective.
00:35:04.60 - 00:35:11.96,Um And then internally um yeah whatever accounting software they're using.
00:35:11.97 - 00:35:21.12,Um Maybe it's ASAP maybe it's something else usually for when we're talking about scope three like for purchase goods and services were starting to spend data and that's like important to pull out.
00:35:21.13 - 00:35:35.19,I think often times that really requires a calm conversation with the accounting department because they don't really understand what we're asking for at first um When we're trying to look at all the spend data and so we have to really explain this is why we're doing it.
00:35:35.83 - 00:35:37.11,This is what we need.
00:35:37.12 - 00:35:41.36,This is like what level we need it broken down to like we don't need every single transaction.
00:35:41.37 - 00:35:46.72,We need kind of like broad categories and and like the names of the customers or suppliers.
00:35:46.73 - 00:35:49.29,Um So those kind of things.
00:35:51.30 - 00:35:57.35,Would you find that do you think that customers would be more susceptible to?
00:35:58.02 - 00:36:05.06,"I don't know, logging into a platform and doing that kind of matching or letting you have all of the data and figuring."
00:36:05.06 - 00:36:09.31,Yeah the matching the matching of the spend data is is like more of an art.
00:36:09.32 - 00:36:14.49,It's like an art rather than a science to where to match the spend data to what we have emissions factors for.
00:36:14.50 - 00:36:19.15,Um Because the client probably doesn't want to do that themselves.
00:36:19.15 - 00:36:33.24,"They'll they'll probably turn to us and say okay what spend category like what category this is how much we spent on this item and if there's not a direct match that's like really clear to see, they'll they'll turn to us and be like, how do we quantify this in terms of emissions?"
00:36:33.25 - 00:36:45.26,"Um That's a common question that we get which departments are typically like dealing with your overall our main contacts really, it's a range."
00:36:45.26 - 00:37:00.73,"So some companies have like a sustainability team who are working with um Other times it's, it's been commonly like pushed onto like the investor relations side of things like say, okay, the investors are asking for the emissions data, you deal with it."
00:37:00.73 - 00:37:07.35,And so that's a little more difficult because they don't have any experience with what we're doing and what the calculations really entail.
00:37:07.36 - 00:37:50.72,"Um Sometimes also facilities, facilities is a, is a source for data and then accounting as well, accounting is a big source for data, so, but ideally there's at least, and usually it's it's a small sustainability department, the some companies have like really big teams um but a lot of people who are just starting out, it's like one or two people um and that's some another recommendation that oftentimes comes out of the work we do with them is you need more internal resources to devote to this um which is sometimes a hard conversation to have because there's not really uh there's not really a desire to do more, but sometimes there is like sometimes there's a lot of internal support and they're like, yeah, we can hire a sustainability analyst for example."
00:37:50.73 - 00:38:00.40,"Yeah, I think that's the path and like jobs in general consultants and then eventually integrated."
00:38:00.41 - 00:38:01.35,Yeah.
00:38:01.36 - 00:38:34.03,"And then and that's I think some kind of the path that we will put some of our clients on is okay the first year two we're doing the emissions calculations for them, but then our recommendations are really like okay if you if you build an internal system or you get onto an external system, like a like a any kind of carbon accounting platform then you could do that, you can do the calculations yourselves and we can step back and become maybe like a third party verifier or assurance provider, things like that."
00:38:35.40 - 00:38:36.08,Okay.
00:38:36.09 - 00:38:50.48,"Um yeah, so we are at you know getting closer to the top of the hour, I don't wanna keep you the full time, everyone has to do but is there any other, you know, anything you want to share?"
00:38:50.49 - 00:39:42.20,"Um As we work on, we're working on a lot of things that you touched on but it would be helpful to just like get an overview understanding of like the things that you most need and yourself and in like the profession of carbon accounting in general, I think we touched on a lot of the things I think like I mentioned, the boundary setting and the and the data collection are probably the biggest challenge is something related to boundary setting, There is like occasionally like Some like the G2 Protocol is great for most in most cases and there are in some cases where you wish it would be a little more explicit about its instructions because I think it was written in with with the goal of getting as many corporations to participate as possible and actually start accounting for their um carbon emissions."
00:39:42.21 - 00:39:56.48,"However, with a different kind of control approaches and some of the different subjective decisions that you can make as a company when you're using the protocol because there's a lot of should rather than Charles and there's a lot of like different ways to do it."
00:39:56.49 - 00:40:21.35,"I don't think that a lot of the times the comparability of different um inventories isn't as like exact because some companies will put the natural gas office, the natural gas usage that they're using in their leased offices, some will put it in scope one because it's a fuel combustion, some will put it in scope to because they consider it purchased energy for example and there's, I've seen it done both ways."
00:40:21.35 - 00:40:24.02,There's not really clear guidance from the G protocol on it.
00:40:24.02 - 00:40:27.38,If you read it one way you can you can make an argument for both sides.
00:40:27.39 - 00:40:32.11,So I think the comparability sometimes uh struggles.
00:40:32.12 - 00:40:48.84,I know there's efforts like um there's something called the carbon call which I think is an is an effort with like Microsoft and a few other big organizations that are trying to really standardize these carbon accounting principles and make with the goal of making emissions inventories comparable to one another.
00:40:48.84 - 00:41:00.33,"So I think that's something that um, would be useful and whether that takes the form of um, I don't know, maybe there's just industry alignment over time or if it's education, I'm not sure."
00:41:00.34 - 00:41:04.58,"But yeah, like accessible data visualization."
00:41:04.59 - 00:41:07.81,"Yeah, we're like, yeah, just okay, this is how everyone else is doing it."
00:41:07.82 - 00:41:18.53,"And, and to some degree, cdP is good for that because you can look at companies cdP responses, but I don't think they're like, I wish that all the methodologies were were open, right?"
00:41:18.53 - 00:41:23.84,"And I know that's something that, that you guys are working on two is like having a, having an open methodology, right?"
00:41:23.97 - 00:41:27.65,"So that people can look at it and say, okay, this is how they're doing it."
00:41:27.66 - 00:41:29.20,We can do it the same way.
00:41:29.21 - 00:41:37.80,"Um, we have confidence that everyone that uses this methodology is doing it the same way and we can compare our results and it can be comparable year over year, right?"
00:41:37.80 - 00:41:39.36,So that doesn't change over time.
00:41:40.54 - 00:41:53.91,"Oh, another another challenge might be that we deal with less frequently is baseline recalculations for, so for when a company maybe they acquire another company and they're like, okay, how does this affect our target?"
00:41:53.92 - 00:42:05.17,"And that's usually a fairly like painstaking process of explaining to them, okay, how they can recalculate their baseline so that the target is not completely out of whack because they acquired someone or if they sold someone."
00:42:05.29 - 00:42:12.73,"So I don't know if if you guys have any capabilities for baseline recalculations or, or like the same as consolidation method."
00:42:13.42 - 00:42:15.61,"So Yeah, kind of."
00:42:15.62 - 00:42:36.24,"So it's like if if a hypothetical company sets their baseline in 2019 for example, and then this past year they acquire like a company of similar size, their emissions all of a sudden you're gonna almost double and that looks like they've, if you just use the same baseline year, it looked like their emissions went like shot up."
00:42:36.24 - 00:42:40.29,"Even though that's really not like organic emissions growth, those emissions were already occurring."
00:42:40.30 - 00:42:42.68,They were just not occurring within the boundary.
00:42:43.10 - 00:42:55.81,"So we'll go through a process sometimes of recalculating that baseline saying that, Okay, if you had acquired that, if you did contain those emissions in your boundary in 2019, this is what your baseline would have been."
00:42:55.81 - 00:43:05.38,"So in reality you're emissions are like, maybe they're flat, but they didn't like they didn't like double over those last two years when in reality those emissions were already occurring just outside the boundary."
00:43:05.69 - 00:43:33.19,"Yeah, I know we're working on that um something similar and I know that it's a heavier math lift than so yeah, that that I would say, yeah, that I'd be interested to see um once you guys have something ready to take a look at for, for that perspective, that's I think it's not super intuitive for clients to understand and the math, because you're at some point you're like back casting for this acquired company, it's a little more complicated."
00:43:33.20 - 00:43:35.89,Um So that would be a tool that I would definitely want to take a look at.
00:43:35.90 - 00:43:37,"Yeah, awesome."
00:43:37 - 00:43:38.28,"Yeah, I'll keep you in mind."
00:43:38.29 - 00:43:47,"We definitely want to start now that there are some customers, you know that we have a good amount, we want to start be able to co create with them."
00:43:47.01 - 00:43:51.97,"So um yeah, I'll make sure to share some of that work once it's ready."
00:43:52.17 - 00:43:53.48,Yeah.
00:43:53.49 - 00:43:55.52,"Um Well, thank you very much."
00:43:55.53 - 00:44:01.44,"This has been super, super helpful and yeah, we'll be in touch."
00:44:01.45 - 00:44:01.74,Great.
